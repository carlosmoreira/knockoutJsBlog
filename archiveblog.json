"content": "Eight months ago, I wouldnt have thought that I would feel so engaged in my life again. I knew something was off but no one understood. Doctors told me that I was pre-menopausal (that did not go over well), I had post partum depression (my baby is 7 years old), or there was nothing wrong with me this is who I am. I couldnt accept these answers. I knew that I was a happy person, I loved to laugh, and I could keep up with my children and find success in my career. Where had that person gone? I was now completely apathetic to my family and marriage; I couldnt make it through the day without a nap, yet couldnt sleep at night; irritated at everything and everyone; no focus; no drive professionally or personally and on top of that I was gaining weight! There had to be more than just my to-do list. Fake it til you feel it was my daily mantra.Thankfully, I have great friends with whom I feel comfortable sharing the good, bad and the ugly. They listened and I realized that I wasnt alone. One had struggled with a lot of the same feelings and told me about Dr. Tutera and SottoPelle. I went home, did my research on hormone replacement therapy and the next morning called and made an appointment with Dr. Gino Tutera. During my appointment, Dr. Tutera reviewed my blood work, explaining to me what my hormone levels were and what they meant affirming that indeed, all of these feelings of fatigue, irritation, weight gain, etc. were all directly related to my hormone levels. He gave me hope! Within 48 hours, I began feeling better, more in control. Each day since, I feel more like myself again. My husband and children have each acknowledged this change. Our home is a happier place we have fun together. I am grateful to Dr. Tutera for his dedication, support to womens (&amp;amp;amp; mens) health and the personal attention he provides to each patient. I have found the joy in my life again!

"content": "&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;Mothers Day is a day to celebrate the woman, the mother who unselfishly gives of herself to those she loves. But often times for many moms, taking on and functioning each day is a struggle. For women who experience feelings of being less than desirable, lack energy, overly irritable at the slightest annoyance, many doctors might conclude: It seems you may be suffering from depression. The quick solution for these doctors is often to prescribe any number of anti-depressants whose side effects may cause additional symptoms such as weight gain, decrease in energy, reduced libido and\/or a lack of motivation. In many ways, those patients may feel worse than when they first saw their doctor!Many physicians hear and see the obvious yet tend to address the &amp;quot;tip of the iceberg.&amp;quot; Some may not take the time to assess the whole patient from the inside out, and be quick to write a prescription. Only to regress to the mentality of &amp;quot;take two of these and call me in the morning&amp;quot; approach. In most cases the patients complaints to their physicians go unheeded or ignored. This often causes great anxiety and depression as well.What these physicians fail to examine is the impact hormones play in the equation. Physicians are quick to put a Band-Aid on what they believe is the symptom, rather than taking the time to look at all the factors that make up the patient and the cause as to why the patient isfeelingthe way they do. The symptoms of&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/0002-9378%2895%2990297-X\/abstract&amp;quot;&amp;gt;depression mentioned above can be caused by hormonal imbalance.&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;An experienced physician will not only request a patient to get their blood work done, but more importantly, a qualified and knowledgeable physician will know how to read your blood lab results. A patient whose lab work indicated normal levels but is unaware that the caregiver has not measured the regulatory hormone, has been done a great disservice. As patients, they have the feeling something is wrong, but when they hear that &amp;quot;everything is normal&amp;quot; and, therefore, &amp;quot;its all in your head,&amp;quot; they cant help but feel frustrated and helpless.Without proper blood work and a seasoned physician to translate the results, an accurate diagnosis may never be realized. Numerous women who suffer from hormonal imbalance are often treated for the wrong diagnosis. These patients often become discouraged whentheircondition worsens and often times spiral into a deeper depression.The proper&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=262&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hormone replacement&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; improves energy levels and overall mood without the need for psychotropic drugs. As women reach menopause, the change in hormones, particularly the drop in estrogen levels,causes the body to handle stress less effectively. As stress increases, hormone levels may become even more out of balance and amplify stress, which can lead to depression. Adecreased production of testosterone in women may also cause mental fogginess, decrease in energy and libido and patients often become depressed due to their unwanted negativephysical and mental symptoms.Being a mom and taking care of thefamilyis difficult enough without struggling through the day withfeelings ofdepression. As we approach Mothers Day, many moms willreceiveheart-felt gifts from their children and spouses. We hope that all women realize, whether they are a mother or not, that the best gift they can give themselvesis the gift of health. At SottoPelle Therapy, we are committed to enriching lives by providing ourscientificallyproven methodology in treating hormonal imbalance. For the many women and &amp;quot;moms&amp;quot; who have inspired us to continue our work, we want to wish you a Happy Mothers Day. Your inspiring stories of how SottoPelle has changed your lives is what keeps us going.&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=39&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Dr. Gino Tutera&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;, a leading authority in hormone replacement, says men and women report the following positive results after beginning hormone replacement therapy withSottoPelle Therapy: Feel much more in control of their bodies and their lives Sleep more consistently and soundly Have more interest in sex Enjoy renewed vitality and zest Realize greater mental clarity Feel more enthusiasm for life Feel calmer, relaxed and more even-keeledThe direct results of proper hormonal treatment helps with the feelings of depression. If your doctor diagnoses you with depression, be sure and ask that your hormone levels be tested and ask them if hormone imbalance might be the cause of your symptoms. If your regular doctor does not share the same drive to find whats ailing you, then its time to find a qualified physician who specializes in hormone replacement such as those trained by Dr Tutera &amp;amp;amp; SottoPelle. No one knows better what your &amp;quot;old self&amp;quot; used to be like but you. With the right medical team on your side, they will help you find the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; you again.&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=39&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Dr. Gino Tutera&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt; is a pioneer and leader in the field of &amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Bio-Identical Hormones&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=268&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;bio-identical hormone&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt; replacement therapy.

Its astonishing to think that the study of physiology actually predates recorded history, even though much of what was believed in those ancient times was couched in magic, superstition and ritual. All the same, sophisticated medical techniques were employed thousands of years before Hippocrates became the father of modern medicine. There is a record; in fact, of Egyptian priest-physicians preforming cancer surgeries as far back as 3000 B.C.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; The human body is an incredibly complex marvel and continues to baffle us in many ways. It remains something of a frontier in spite of significant progress. Nevertheless, as we look at the average human lifespan, which in classical Greece is thought to have been around 28 years and today ranges between 70 and 80-plus years in Western counties, its obvious how far weve come.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; But, as the saying goes,&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;what a long, strange trip its been!&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; One experience that has remained sadly true though time, regardless of our highly evolved scientific body of knowledge: in most of the worlds cultures, a woman suffering from hormone-related problems continues to be the target of superstition, intolerance and misunderstanding.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; For many, many centuries, menstruating women were shunned and considered&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;impure&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;. Menopausewas likewise seen as shameful. A woman was thought to have outlived her usefulness if she could no longer bear children. Around 1700 and thereafter, menopause began to be viewed as a&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;disease&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;something that lingers even today. Women were often subjected to grotesque methods of treatment that included dangerous or life-threatening surgeries in order to cure them. The Victorian era brought with it the idea that womens physical constitution predisposed her to insanity. The womb and brain were said to have a direct relationship- one that sent many symptomatic woman to the asylum as a&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;remedy&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;for her hysteria.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Seems pretty archaic, doesnt it? To this day, women still remain subject to outdated attitudes and treatment methods for their hormone woes, not to mention out-and-out deceptions. If not being sold a bill of goods on the safety of synthetics and lack of data on bio-identicals by the pharmaceutical industry, then its the conventional medical community encouraging women to be fearful of their own hormonesvital contributors to a persons well-being and the foundation for the healthiest and most vibrant years of life! No wonder so many women continue to be utterly bewildered by hormone replacement choices.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;"

In your twenties and thirties, the bodys ability to maintain homeostasis defines you physically, mentally and emotionally, and helps protect you from a myriad of diseases. On the reverse side, the process of aging markedly decreases the production of endocrine hormones and increases your vulnerability to cardiovascular disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes and other long-term, degenerative diseases.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; A synergetic relationship exists between every process, every hormone and every organ, gland and cell in the body. Disrupt any of it, especially the production of hormones, weather through the aging process, genetic predisposition, illness or surgical procedure, and physiologic disruption ensures, which in turn creates an inviting environment for health problems.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Ill use thetestosteroneas an example. Research has shown that human testosterone has many important functions in addition to enhancing the libido. It augments bone strength, density and the ability of bone to repair itself. Testosterone also improves mood and heightens the feeling of well-being; increases muscle strength and mass; thickens the skin; promotes optimal brain function and more.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; If testosterone produces all of these beneficial effects, it only makes sense that when it diminishes significantly, as it does in the aging male and female, the health and welfare of the individual also weakens. There is now a great deal of medical literature supporting this conclusion, with many new research studies underway. Current literature already corroborates that low levels of testosterone are directly linked to:&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Osteoporosisand hip fracture&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Heart diseaseand myocardial infraction&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Strokes and cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Prostate cancer (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;indeed, low levels create higher risk&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Senile dementia&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;A recent study published in&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.j-alz.com%2fpress%2f2010%2f20100215.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2010 in theJournal of Alzheimers Disease&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;has additionally linked low testosterone in older men to Alzheimers disease. Still, there are many mainstream medical professionals who question these results and refuse to believe in the therapeutic value of maintaining normal testosterone levels in aging men and women. Low testosterone is not considered a life-threatening problem and many physicians simply do not know how to diagnose or treat it.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy for Women&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=262&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Estrogen&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;is another case in point.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Fact #1: Estrogen helps maintain healthy blood vessels and provides protection from heart attacks and strokes.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Fact #2:&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.heart.org\/HEARTORG\/Advocate\/IssuesandCampaigns\/QualityCare\/Women-and-Heart-Disease_UCM_430484_Article.jsp&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women over the age of 75.&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy for Women&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=262&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Women&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; commonly have a low risk for cardiovascular disease until menopause, around age 50, when their estrogen levels plummet and the ratio of estradiol to estrone goes haywire. Menopause and estrogen imbalance are also associated with osteoporosis, breast cancer and other serious health issues.&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Estrogen, in proper balance, is your friend!&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; Research indicates that, besides heart and artery protection, estrogen protects against cognitive decline during aging and perhaps even against Alzheimers disease. Studies of post-mortem brains of women with Alzheimers disease, reported in the online edition of the&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;in 2005, showed they had significantlylower levels of estrogen in their brain tissue as compared to women of similar age without the disorder.&amp;amp;nbsp;Excerpt from The Science of SottoPelle, written by Gino Tutera MD, FACOG&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Gino Tutera MD FACOG&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=39&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Dr. Gino Tutera&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;is a pioneer and leader in the field of&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Bio-Identical Hormones&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=268&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bio-identical hormone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;replacement therapy.

A deficiency in testosterone can be devastating with symptoms including: erectile dysfunction, weight gain, depression\/irritability and lack of mental clarity, among other symptoms.&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The problem starts when the testicles slowly begin to reduce testosterone production at around age 30. By the time a man reaches his 50s, he may be feeling miserable. This slow but eminent progression is called Andropause, the clinical term sometimes coined as male menopause. A man over the age of 40 needs to think about having his testosterone checked with a simple blood test to determine a baseline for the next decades of his life. Addressing the symptoms of low testosterone is not enough. I suggest forgoing the injections, creams, gels, patches and erectile dysfunction drugs. They may provide temporary relief but will do nothing to achieve the homeostatic environment, or internal equilibrium in which your internal systems thrive. This can only be achieved by adjusting your bodys physiological processes using low-dose, bio-identical testosterone pellets, such as the method found with SottoPelle Therapy. This methodology provides a 24\/7 delivery of testosterone- just like your body used to at your peak condition.&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Your hormone deficiency is determined from the results of your blood work and symptoms. The pellets are injected into the hip and can last anywhere from 4 to 5 months; the more active the patient, the faster the pellet will dissolve.&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: justify;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Not all pellets or physicians are created equally. Synthetic hormones can be harmful to your health and not all physicians are trained to provide hormonal replacement. Do your research, ask questions, and get a second opinion.

Unlike other methods, Hormone Pellet Replacement Therapy does not invite foreign synthetics into your body. This method uses pure hormone and a small percentage of human fatty acid to work with the existing hormones in your body.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Do Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, women going through menopause have a higher likelihood of gaining weight during this time.

However, certain symptoms may be signs of hormone imbalance due to andropause. The following are six common signs that may be due to hormonal changes in men.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Thinning of Hair &amp;amp;amp; Loss of Body Hair&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Decreased testosterone levels leads to loss of scalp and body hair because an imbalance of testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exists. . DHT inhibits the growth of new hair cells and hair cells are not replaced after they fall out when DHT activity is higher than testosterone activity.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Weight Gain&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Weight gain is commonly reported by men during andropause. The decrease in testosterone levels leads to higher insulin and cortisol levels. When men have high cortisol levels, their bodies can increase the production of fat cells and increases appetite. High levels of insulin and cortisol also decreases metabolism and continues to decrease testosterone. The combination of these effects leads to weight gain.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Decreased Libido&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;As energy decreases with lower testosterone levels, mens sex drive often follows. The libido is considered highly dependent on hormone levels and is affected by the changes in hormones as men enter andropause. The loss of energy and strength during this time in a mans life also plays into a lowered libido, as does less stimulation of the libido center in the brain.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Trouble sleeping&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Low testosterone and heightened cortisol levels can lead to sleep apnea. Because human growth hormones are made during the first ninety minutes of sleep, interrupted sleep leads to the disruption of hormone production. When sleep is interrupted it can lead to worsened fatigue and insomnia, as well as, reduce insulin sensitivity.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Depression&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Depression is a common side effect of decreased testosterone. Decreased testosterone leads to lower serotonin levels in the brain. Often times, men are not accustomed to being vocal about their emotions, but it is important for them to share these feelings with a medical professional as it may be a symptom of low testosterone.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Muscle Loss&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Testosterone is a major component in the production of strong muscles in men. As the testosterone decreases in men, their muscle strength can also decrease as they lose energy and their bodies begin turning muscle fibers into fat.&amp;amp;nbsp;It is important to speak to your doctor about any symptoms you are having. Even if you may not see a connection between what you are experiencing and the possible cause of it, a trained medical professional can advise."

A &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/http:\/\/archinte.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?articleid=1700432&amp;quot;&amp;gt;study was recently released from the Journal of the American Medical Association&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; on the long term side effects from hormonal treatments for menopausal and post-menopausal women. The study found that 1,326 women who were taking synthetic hormones for more than seven years had no risk to cognitive functions from the ages 50-55 but that there was some cognitive decline in women age 65 and older.This study may seem frightening to those on or considering hormonal treatment but a closer look shows its flaws. One of the major flaws found by experts was the use of conjugated equine estrogen which is found in horse urine. This hormone replacement should never be used in humans. It does not produce protective effects that human estradiol does. It also causes increased breast stimulation. By performing the study with the basis flawed it created results that may not be typical of natural estrogen replacement therapies.SottoPelle uses high-quality bio identical 17-Beta Estradiol hormone pellets. 17-Beta Estradiol is the only estrogen that improves cognition of the brain, no other estrogen does this. These pellets are completely identical to the hormones naturally produced by your own body. They are derived by botanicals but are 100 percent identical to those already in your body. In no way whatsoever is conjugated equine estrogen used in SottoPelle Therapy.The study done by the Journal of American Medical Association had a fundamental flaw when it used conjugated equine estrogen instead of a bio-identical hormone replacement. It is known that equine estrogen has negative effects before the study was concluded and is used in bio-identical hormone replacement therapies. This overlooked variable created negative results that should have no bearing on other therapies as they are not structurally similar.If you would like to learn more about options for bio-identical hormone replacement using pellets, please visit &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=341&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/find-a-location\/&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;"

Knowledge is one of the greatest weapons and when it comes to hot flashes, it is essential to arm yourself with the correct information to take action. By learning about hot flashes and consulting your doctor, you can be more prepared in what you could be dealing with.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;What are hot flashes?&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Low estrogen is often the main cause of hot flashes in women. Low estrogen has a harsh effect on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls sleep, appetite, sex hormones and temperature. The hypothalamus is deceived by low estrogen levels into believing that the body is too hot and attempts to remedy it by ridding the body of excess heat. Hot flashes are the dilation of blood vessels at the skins surface attempting to cool down your body. Instead of experiencing a cooling effect you feel suddenly warm. This feeling is usually most intense in the face, neck and chest. Sometimes a hot flash can cause a reddening or blotchiness of the skin, which is referred to as a hot flush. A hot flash can also be accompanied by perspiration, a rapid heartbeat, or chills. By balancing your hormones, you can put an end to hot flashes.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;What can you do to ease hot flashes? &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stay cool&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;When a hot flash strikes, you can remove an article of clothing to keep your body temperature stable. Another option is to decrease a rooms temperature by either opening a window or using a fan of some sort. This will also keep the air flowing throughout the room which helps keep your body comfortable.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Relax&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;It is important to remember that these hot flashes are not signs of a medical problem. They are only your bodys response to changing hormones and often will ease in intensity after the first or second year of menopause. Rhythmic breathing exercises can help keep you calm and focused. Reducing stress can be imperative for keeping your body stability.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stay Hydrated&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Drinking cold water before, during, and after a flash can help keep your body hydrated and stable.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How can you prevent hot flashes? &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT)&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;BHRT continues to be one of the most effective treatments for preventing hot flashes. By using hormone pellets you can experience complete relief of your hot flash symptoms along with other uncomfortable menopausal effects such as vaginal dryness and night sweats. The pellets can work with your body for up to six months and you dont have to worry about taking a pill or using a cream every day.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exercise&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Exercising can help reduce the intensity of your hot flashes and help in preventing them. Fat cells store estrogen and by reducing your fat cells your body can more effectively regulate the estrogen in your body.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Avoid triggers&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;By avoiding certain triggers such as stress, caffeine, alcohol, smoking and spicy foods you can sometimes evade hot flashes."

"content": "Miriam E. TuckerMay18,2014 LAS VEGAS Contrary to recent findings, a new retrospective study of data from 40 specialized clinics around the United States has found that testosterone therapy in men is not associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke and may even be cardioprotective.The late-breaking results were presented here at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) 23rd Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress by Robert Tan, MD, director of the Opal Medical Clinic, Houston, research director of the Low T Institute, and clinical professor of family and community medicine at the University of Texas.Among 19,968 hypogonadal men who received testosterone therapy during a 5-year period (20092014) at Low T Centers nationwide (www.lowtcenter.com), the risk for MI was 7-fold lower and the risk for stroke 9 times lower compared with samples from the general population. Further, there was no evidence of worsening of preexisting MI or stroke in patients treated with testosterone.&amp;quot;There has been a lot of hype and concern....I want to try to explain the other side of the story,&amp;quot; Dr. Tan said in introducing his presentation.He told Medscape Medical News, &amp;quot;When compared with other databases looking at rates of MI and strokes, it appears testosterone is cardioprotective.&amp;quot;This finding is counter to those of 2 widely reported recent studies that have generated enormous controversy and prompted an investigation into testosterone safety by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. The US Endocrine Society has also called for randomized controlled trials to investigate testosterone therapy and cardiovascular risk and has advised against giving testosterone therapy to men who have had a recent cardiovascular event.But others have hit back, including the US Androgen Study Group, which has highlighted what it says are key flaws in these 2 widely cited studies; it is campaigning for 1 of them to be retracted and also claims that numerous other studies have shown a protective effect of testosterone.Session moderator and AACE president-elect George Grunberger, MD, founder of the Grunberger Diabetes Institute, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, told Medscape Medical News that he thinks Dr. Tans study results &amp;quot;will help. Hopefully, it will reduce pushback from patients. The last thing you want is for people to stop out of fear.&amp;quot;However, although he called the new findings &amp;quot;very encouraging,&amp;quot; he said that because the study was retrospective, it is not definitive. &amp;quot;This wasnt a prospective trial. The gold standard is a randomized controlled trial to answer the question.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Does Testosterone Protect?&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;The new study was part of an internal quality-management program at the Low T Centers, which follow strict protocols requiring a definitive diagnosis of hypogonadism (total T &amp;amp;lt; 350 ng\/dL and free T &amp;amp;lt; 10 ng\/dL) for starting testosterone therapy. Patients are also closely monitored while on treatment, with regular 1- or 2-week physical assessments and laboratory work.Data were extracted from the electronic health record. In addition, the centers were called to make sure that International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) coding had been updated, and families of patients who had MIs or strokes were also interviewed.Of 39,937 patients seen during 20092014, approximately 50% met the criteria for treatment. Of the treated patients, 4 had nonfatal MIs, and 3 had probable fatal MIs, giving a rate of 30 new MIs per 100,000. Of the 46 patients with pretherapy MIs, none had adverse outcomes after receiving testosterone, Dr. Tan said.There were 2 strokes among the treated patients, giving a rate of 10 new strokes per 100,000. Of 12 patients with pretherapy stroke, none had adverse events after testosterone.Because the patients who did not qualify for testosterone therapy were not followed up, Dr. Tan and colleagues compared their figures with those from other published data sets of the general population.The rate for MI at Kaiser Permanente Northern California was 208 per 100,000, and the stroke rate found in the Northern Manhattan Registry was 93 per 100,000.Compared with these numbers, Dr Tan reported the rate ratio (RR) for MI in the testosterone-treated Low T Center patients was 0.14 (P &amp;amp;lt; .0001), a 7-fold lower risk, and for stroke, the RR was 0.107 (P &amp;amp;lt; .0001), 9-fold lower than the general population.&amp;quot;Our study showed that carefully monitored testosterone therapy may actually protect against MI and stroke. Its retrospective, but I think for now its as good as we can come up with. At least from our experience, there was no evidence of increased heart attacks or strokes from people treated with testosterone,&amp;quot; Dr. Tan observed.But what is really needed, he told Medscape Medical News, is &amp;quot;a large, randomized controlled study with very careful monitoring of patients compliance, hematocrit, and other preexisting cardiac risk factors over at least a 5-year period.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Why the Differences?&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;There are many possible explanations for the difference in findings, Dr. Tan told Medscape Medical News.One of the recently quoted studies showing a 36% increased risk for MI among 55,593 men who received a new prescription for testosterone therapy, published in PLoS One earlier this year, was based on a heterogeneous patient population that was seen at different practices with different protocols and that received varying exposures to testosterone for less than 3 months duration.In contrast, the Low T Center population was more a homogeneous group, received regular follow-ups, and had longer exposure to testosterone therapy, he noted.And in the other oft-cited recent study ? published in JAMA in November 2013 and found a 30% increased risk for death, MI, or ischemic stroke among 1223 older veterans on testosterone therapy who underwent coronary angiography ? Dr. Tan said the mean T level with treatment was only 332.2 ng\/dL, &amp;quot;which is at the low end. Our patients reached, on average, 543 ng\/dL. Perhaps the lower range in the JAMA study led to the increased risk of MI?&amp;quot;He also noted that one-third of the patients in the JAMA study received testosterone patches, whereas 90% of Low T Center patients received testosterone via injection, and fewer than 1% used the patch. Moreover, only 60% of the JAMA study patients had their testosterone levels reassessed, whereas 100% of Low T Center patients receive such reassessments. &amp;quot;I think close monitoring for safety is essential in testosterone therapy,&amp;quot; Dr. Tan said.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The RCT Dilemma&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;In conversation with reporters about the new study, Dr. Grunberger said, &amp;quot;This is hypothesis-generating. Lets do a real study. I was glad to see this, and it is important, but you have to take it at face value when you look at retrospective chart review....Before you start making claims, you need truly high-level, classy randomized trial .&amp;quot;Of course, he noted, &amp;quot;RCTs cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Thats the dilemma we have with everything we do.&amp;quot; And they also take a long time, particularly when they are designed to look at end points such as cardiovascular events, and companies often say they cannot afford the investment.&amp;quot;The economics, the math is just incredibly complex....Thats the sad reality. I really dont know if theres a shortcut. You try to enrich with people at high risk, but then theyre not representative of the general population. So, clinicians just have to fly by the seat of their pants....Thats the dilemma.&amp;quot;The study was unfunded. Dr. Tan is an active practitioner of testosterone therapy in his own clinical practice at Opal Medical Clinic, which is unrelated to Low T Centers. He analyzed the data but does not see patients at the Low T Centers. His coauthors do, however. He has not received any pharmaceutical honoraria or research grants in the past 5 years. Dr. Grunberger has received speaker honoraria from Amarin, Janssen, Merck, Sanofi, Santarus, Takeda, and Valeritas. He has received research support from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk.American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) 23rd Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress.

"content": "Many women hear the word menopause and start to think of hot flashes and night sweats. They get nervous and sweat. Cry! Although this is a phase of life for every woman experiences, there is often a sense of embarrassment and dread. Women typically think that they are now considered old. Nothing could be further from the truth. Think back to High School health class and it teaches us that menopause ends ones fertility, but it tends to leave out that a woman can still remain healthy, sexual and vital after they go through menopause. Like any other milestone in our life, menopause is just another phase. How we manage that phase physically, mentally, and socially impacts how well the transition and outcome will be.Menopause occurs when a woman stops menstruating and usually happens when they are in their 40s or 50s, sometimes as early as their twenties. Illness or surgery can alter the onset of menopause for some women. When a woman starts to go through menopause, her body undergoes a series of changes that bring on a variety of symptoms. Some women dont treat their symptoms at all and suffer, while others complain about being uncomfortable.Here are a few ways to deal with symptoms of menopause:&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hot Flashes&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;Women experiencing hot flashes suddenly become very hot out of nowhere and theyll start to sweat. We all experience different triggers, so its good to notice what those triggers are and how they can be avoided. Such triggers include: stress, caffeine, spicy foods, alcohol or just being in a very hot place. Its recommended to dress in layers so that they can be removed with a hot flash happens and to use a fan at home or at work. Also, taking deep, slow breaths when a hot flash starts can prevent one from becoming too hot and bothered.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;ol start=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Vaginal Dryness&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;During menopause women tend to be more self-conscious of their bodies, it is important to keep your romantic and sexual life comfortable and ongoing as it will also help with your self-esteem. Menopause can make a womans vagina become unusually dry and the tissue becomes thinner, so if you are experiencing discomfort discuss it with your doctor.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;ol start=&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sleeping Problems&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;Sleep seems to evade most women during menopause. The lack of sleep only worsens the other symptoms you may be experiencing. Some suggested ways to help get some rest is to be physically active throughout the day. Also, avoid large meals before bedtime and try drinking something warm before sleeping like warm milk or caffeine-free tea. If you wake up at night and cant go back to sleep, do something relaxing like reading a book until you are sleepy again. But if you cant get to sleep on your own, you might have to talk to your doctor about these sleep problems.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;ol start=&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mood Swings&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;Some women feel crankier and moodier than usual when menopause hits them, so its important that they get enough sleep and rest to feel their best. Also, avoid stress and look for positive ways to ease any stress you might have. Women often find themselves very depressed during menopause. If you feel yourself unable to function, you should contact a medical professional for assistance. Hormonal imbalance during this time can wreak havoc with your moods and emotional stability. Having support with friends, family, or group can help in dealing with some of the symptoms.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;ol start=&amp;quot;5&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Memory Problems&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;When going through menopause, a common complaint is of memory trouble. The best thing to do is to stay physically active and get enough sleep to improve these symptoms. Also, mental exercises can keep memory lapses at bay.Women can always do something to lessen their symptoms when going through menopause, but they can also talk to their doctors about taking bio identical hormone therapy that can ease or even eliminate the symptoms caused by menopause.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

When I visit the doctor, the front-desk person confirms my identity by asking for my birth month and date.Each time this happens, Im reminded how much both businessesthe drug retailer and the medical groupknow about me. While the drug retailer may not have my Social Security number, at least I dont &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;think&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; they do, they have enough of my personally identifiable information (PII) that a cyber-criminal could do some damage to my good name if the companys computer systems were hacked.And gosh, the medical group has it allSocial, full name, address, birthdate, health insurance data and, of course, my medical history. If its computer systems were hacked, I could be pretty vulnerable to all sorts of identity theftfor years to come.Hey, pharmacy! Hey, medical group! Are you folks on this? Like &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;seriously&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; on it?What made me think of this was &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/articles\/protect-your-medical-data-from-identity-theft-1415986497&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;a recent article&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; in The Wall Street Journal on healthcare records and identity theft. And there was one quote in particular that caught my eye:&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Digitized records are much easier to steal than paper ones. Once you needed a convoy to haul away records. Now all you need is a thumb drive.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;That quotes from Deborah Peel, a physician and founder of Patient Privacy Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group in Austin, Texas. And it really hit home.Think about it: Weve heard a lot of in recent years about making our healthcare records more portable, so we could easily move them from doctor to doctor and hospital to hospital. The last time I changed doctors, when mine retired, I had to request in writingtwicethat my former doctors office personnel copy and send my handwritten medical charts to my new doctor. My new medical group is a lot more technologically savvy. They have a smartphone app for scheduling appointments, for crying out loud!Butif patient data is digitized, that makes it so much more vulnerable than when it sat in physical folders in a doctors office. No convoy needed. A neer-do-well employee or a determined and savvy cybercriminal with access could make quick work of it.And in fact, in 2013, health care data made up 43 percent of major data breaches reported. This, according to the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.idtheftcenter.org\/images\/breach\/UPDATED_ITRC_Breach_Stats_Report_Summary_2013.pdf&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Identity Theft Resource Center&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.How should you protect yourself? Above all, protect your Social Security number. Just because someone asks for it, doesnt mean you have to provide it.These additional tips come from the book, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Stolen-Identity-Anyone-Birthdate-Security\/dp\/0692234837&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Stolen Identity&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;, by author Katie Morell and published earlier this year by LifeLock:&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Guard your insurance card like a credit card.&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; A common practice for a lost or stolen credit card is to order a new one with a new number. But what if you lose your medical insurance card? Always ask for a new number, because otherwise someone can use that lost or stolen card to get medical services and the claim will go through as if you are the patient.&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Check your Explanation of Benefits forms&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;padding-left: 30px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Read the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents that come in the ?mail or online following a doctors visit or medical procedure.

"content": "&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;is pain that occurs below the belly button and has lasted longer than six months in duration. As one of the most common medical problems affecting women, it is estimated that as many as one out of every five women age 18-50 has chronic pelvic pain that has lasted longer than a year. Additionally, one out of every ten visits to the gynecologists office is related to pelvic pain. Longstanding chronic pelvic pain can have a significant impact on the physical, emotional and social well-being of a woman. The process of evaluating, diagnosing and treating chronic pelvic pain requires patience, empathy and understanding from both the patient and the physician.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Causes of Chronic Pelvic Pain&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;The four most common causes of chronic pelvic pain are: endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic scarring\/adhesions, and painful bladder syndrome (also known as interstitial cystitis).Most people assume that pelvic pain only arises from the female reproductive organs (i.e. uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and vagina). However, organs from other body systems may also cause pain in the pelvic region. The bladder, colon, and the muscles of the pelvic floor or the front area of your abdomen can also cause chronic pelvic pain.Additionally, chronic pelvic pain may arise from scar tissue (or adhesions) that arises after a person has had pelvic or abdominal surgery, or from damaged nerves in the pelvic area. In fact, up to 50% of women with chronic pelvic pain will have more than one source of the pain. Also, prolonged pain in one organ may cause pain in another organ system over time. The multi-system etiology of pelvic pain often makes the diagnosis and management challenging for both patient and physician.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Other Causes of Chronic Pelvic Pain by Organ System&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; Gynecological System: Chronic pelvic and uterine infections, dilated and congestedveins in the pelvic area, uterine fibroid GI System: Chronic constipation, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohns Disease orUlcerative Colitis) Urological System: Recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder injury Musculoskeletal System: Fibromyalgia, Pelvic Floor Myalgia, Poor Posture, ChronicLow Back Pain, Trigger Points&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are the &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Symptoms?&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;The symptoms of chronic pelvic pain vary widely among women. Some women may have a mild, dull constant ache in the pelvis. Others may experience sharp, intense pelvic pain that may greatly limit their normal activities. Other symptoms associated with chronic pelvic pain include pain with intercourse (dyspareunia), pain with urination, and bowel movements, pain with menstrual cycles (dysmenorrhea), pain in the lower back that may radiate down the leg, and a feeling of constant heaviness in the pelvic area.Additionally, dealing with long-standing chronic pelvic pain can affect the psychological well-being of a woman. As a result, symptoms of depression frequently are found in patients with chronic pelvic pain. In some patients, the pain leads to depression. However, in others both the depression and chronic pelvic pain may be the result of past life traumas. Studies have shown that up to 40-50% of women with chronic pelvic pain have a history of physical or sexual abuse. The symptoms of chronic pelvic pain can exhibit a strong mind-body connection. It is important to be very open with your physician and always expect confidentiality.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Diagnosis&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;The initial work-up may include a combination of the following: blood tests, urinalysis, screening for pelvic infections, pap smear, pelvic ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, laparoscopy of the pelvis and abdomen, and cystoscopy of the bladder. The choice and extent of diagnostic testing is guided by the findings during the history and physical exam. Diagnosing and treating chronic pelvic pain requires patience and open mindedness. In some patients the diagnosis may be clearly evident from a few diagnostic tests. In others, the diagnosis may require more extensive work, and is often a process of elimination involving the most likely causes of the pain. Obtaining a detailed history is key in the evaluation process. Therefore, it is important that patients prepare for their initial visit with a mental or written list of symptoms, medical and surgical history and any prior evaluations that have been performed to evaluate the pain. While the initial evaluation of chronic pelvic pain often begins with the gynecologist, some patients may require additional evaluation by other specialists including urologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, pain specialists, physical therapists and psychologists.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Treatments&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;While the optimal goal of any treatment is to provide a cure, the reality is that in many cases long-standing chronic pelvic pain is not curable. Instead, the goal is to decrease the pain symptoms so that a woman may improve her quality of life and increase her functional activities. Straightforward cases of chronic pelvic pain can be treated with a single treatment plan. However, in most cases, the multi-organ system etiology of chronic pain requires a detailed approach to treatment. Depending on the cause of the pain, treatment may include a combination of medications, surgery, behavioral therapy and physical therapy. The results from treatment may not be instant, and in some cases may take up to several months to provide relief. The treatment process can be long and frustrating as several combinations of therapy may be necessary before finding the effective one. Remember the disease was chronic and pain relief is possible with time, patience and collaboration between the patient and physician.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;To learn more or to schedule an appointment for a complete evaluation, please call us at 913.888.7546.&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;To Your Health!

Understanding these symptoms help women recognize the role of hormones in their adult years and how they play into their appearance, health and positive outlook on life.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;1. &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Weight Gain&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;As your body stops ovulating, your ovaries stop producing estrogen. As your bodys source of estrogen is discontinued, it pursues other ways of harvesting this hormone. One source of estrogen is fat cells that produce the hormone. Your body begins to retain these fat cells which causes an increase in weight and presents a difficult time when attempting to lose excess fat. A decrease in progesterone causes your body to retain water and leads to a bloating effect that is doubly unfavorable. A decrease in testosterone leads to muscle and bone loss, as well as, difficulty in burning fat.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;2. &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Insomnia&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;If you are experiencing difficulty sleeping you may be feeling the effects of a decrease in melatonin. Melatonin is the natural hormone in your body that helps maintain your circadian rhythm. As you age, your levels of melatonin decrease along with estrogen levels. Estrogen helps maintain sleep as well. By not getting enough sleep, the body is not able to heal and rejuvenate itself. A lack of sleep effects many different hormones and tips them off balance. Deficiency in estrogen leads to decreased serotonin levels which make sleeping soundly and getting good quality sleep difficult.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;3. &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Vaginal Dryness&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Levels of high progesterone and low estrogen result in the drying of the vaginal walls. The fluctuations of progesterone and estrogen can also lead to increased stress and cause a lack of sexual desire and a low libido. Stress suppresses libido. Low testosterone causes a marked loss in libido and is the major or cause of sexual dysfunction.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stay tuned for the rest of the article when we remember where it went...&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;"

Low estrogen has a harsh effect on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls sleep, appetite, sex hormones and temperature. The hypothalamus is deceived by low estrogen levels into believing that the body is too hot and attempts to remedy it by ridding the body of excess heat. Low estrogen causes the pituitary gland to over secrete a hormone called FSH which causes hot flashes, irritability and sleeplessness.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;5. &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Mood Swings&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Both estrogen and serotonin regulate emotions. During menopause, estrogen fluctuates. This fluctuation leads to a decrease in serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that when the levels are altered effects a persons mood. These two factors cause emotional instability that is expressed in mood swings.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;6. &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Foggy Memory&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Memory problems during menopause is commonly referred to as a brain fog. This symptom is very common. When the estrogen decreases, there is a diminished proportion of neurotransmitter responsible for communicating within the brain. Low testosterone levels cause decreased stimulation of the major hormone receptors in the temporal lobe of the brain causing loss of memory, decreased focus, decreased problem solving and poor multitasking capability."

But long-lasting is not a word you want to hear when associated with a migraine. Over 36 million people in the U.S. are affected by migraines with women being diagnosed more often. Unfortunately, the cause of migraines is often misdiagnosed leading many down a long path away from true relief from their insufferable pain. Migraines can last up to 72 hours and often are caused by hormonal changes associated with their menstrual cycle.&amp;amp;nbsp;Migraines typical including a variety of severe neurological symptoms often marked by an intense throbbing pain on one side of the head (although in 1\/3 ofmigraine attacks, both sides are affected). Symptoms of a migraine along with the pain include visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, extreme sensitivity to sound, light, touch and smell, and tingling or numbness in the extremities or face.Hormones are a main cause of migraines in women. The estrogen hormone is related to signals that trigger your brain to think you are in pain. As estrogen levels drop around the time of a womans menstrual cycle she becomes more susceptible to pain. Serotonin, another hormone, is also a cause for these painful long-lasting headaches. These misdiagnoses can cause women to look for migraine treatments that will never completely work for them because they are not addressing the root of the problem. Menstrual migraines can often leave the victim debilitated and unable to perform usual tasks.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;text-decoration: underline;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Treatment&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Exercise, regular sleep, and eating healthy foods are a great way to help reduce migraines and relieve the stress that can be contributing to your pain. When a migraine hits it is helpful to rest in a dark room with no extra stimuli and take an over the counter medicine such as Tylenol or Excedrin Migraine though overuse of over the counter pain medicine can result in rebound headaches that make your headaches worse.When speaking about menstrual migraines it is vital to address the role of hormones. Knowing that estrogen and serotonin levels affect the frequency and duration of menstrual migraines it is essential to assess and evaluate these critical hormones. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;What is Hormone Replacement Therapy?&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=260&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therap&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;y (BHRT) is a great option to discuss with your doctor because it directly levels your hormone levels so that your body can function to the best of its ability.

Living in pain is awful but there is something you can do about it. Addressing your hormones is the first step to living menstrual migraine free.

Many women go under diagnosed because of the failure of physicians to apply a scientific method for diagnosis. Scientifically, a diagnosis is when the level of follicle stimulation hormone (FSH) reaches a level greater than 23 miu\/ml, whether she is menstruating or not. Peri-menopause typically begins when a woman is in her 40s and can average 4 to 8 years. Menopause occurs roughly in women their early 50s. Every year it is estimated that 1.3 million women are expected to reach menopause.I will take you through a series of symptoms and what a woman should look for and what should she do next? NO woman should ever have to suffer through any symptom(s) nor feel less than a woman. Menopause is a natural part of the aging process. Not all symptoms will show in all women. Please use this as a guide only.During the menopausal transition women may experience sexual dysfunction as well as depressive symptoms. Due to the loss of estrogen, ones symptoms can also consist of:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hot flashes&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Severe sweating can happen both day and night&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Insomnia&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vaginal dryness&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vaginal discomfort&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Irritability&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loss of memory or fuzzy thinking&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Cold sweats&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Irregular periods&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Anxiety&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mood swings&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Headaches&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sadness&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;When a woman comes to me with symptoms, as previously stated, I take the time to listen to what each individual patient is telling me, never discounting any of their feelings or symptoms. My immediate instinct as a Doctor is to help her improve her symptoms and get her on the right track to feeling like a woman again. My first recommendation is that they have a simple blood test that will measure their pituitary hormone Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level. Depending upon the blood work I get back from their testings, my suggested and most successful form of hormone replacement would be via the Pellet Hormone Delivery System (PHDS). Women who have their hormones replaced via PHDS allows the body to recreate a continuous flow of hormones that the ovaries normally and previously produced within their bodies. This method of delivery is more important than any other type of replacement therapy as it is surgically inserted and allows the body to control the release of the hormones over time. Nothing in an oral, patch or cream can reproduce the normal hormone correction that is needed.Always remember to go with your instinct regarding how you are feeling and if you are displaying some of the symptoms above, as each woman knows best how they should feel and seek the advice of a doctor. Dont ever give in or give up to the ugly face of menopause.Remember to put your fears away, as life during and after menopause can be quite enjoyable!"

"content": "Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not just a young boy problem like many misconceive it to me. Even women going through menopause and perimenopause may experience the negative symptoms associated with ADHD. Often times this disorder is not detected in women until they are older and have been experiencing it unknowingly for a long time. ADHD symptoms in adults can vary from those in children. Some ADHD symptoms include disorganization, marital problems, reckless driving, chronic lateness and angry outbursts.A study from the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) was conducted with 75 women ages 40 to 60 to determine whether or not brain fogs around the time of menopause are actual cognitive changes. After a battery of tests were conducted the study confirms that they are. The scientists in this study found that particularly when performing a challenging task, a woman can have memory difficulties by not being as capable of keeping her focus and attention on the task at hand.Many patients that come to &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; complain about memory loss and the inability to focus. With our patients, we have found that low testosterone is a vital factor in the diagnosis of ADHD symptoms. Some others believe that it is low estrogen levels that contribute to these increased risks and others believe that hormones do not play into memory problems at all. After performing our own tests before and after testosterone treatments, we have found that by balancing testosterone levels patients are more able to focus and keep their attention on what they are doing.Growing older is difficult but when you cant remember where you left your keys or stop tasks midway there could be an underlying concern. You should speak with your doctor about your memory loss concerns. Many people brush off memory problems and associate it only with aging. With the knowledge that you could be suffering from another problem that could worsen if left untreated, you should be motivated to seek help for a relief from these upsetting symptoms.&amp;amp;nbsp;"

"content": "As you age you may find yourself combated with a number of conditions that worsen as you grow older. A common disorder like this is hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism symptoms may mimic the symptoms of menopause, particularly relating to muscle strength, memory, and metabolism, the two are often confused but a single solution may not address all ailments.Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is not producing enough of certain important hormones to meet the bodys needs. If hypothyroidism goes untreated, it may result in heart disease, obesity or joint pain. Hypothyroidism often affects women over the age of sixty. If you or a family member have an autoimmune disease or you have undergone radiation therapy you could be at a greater risk for this condition.The symptoms of this condition can often go undetected in the early stages. Dry skin, fatigue, depression, and constipation are common signs. These may lead to unexplained weight gain, muscle weakness, joint pain or stiffness, a slowed heart rate or impaired memory. Testing for hypothyroidism is often done through a blood test and is generally recommended that older women are screened for it routinely.Treating hypothyroidism with a bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) such as SottoPelle allows your body to receive the hormones it needs without heavy medications. A medication that specifically addresses the thyroid may be needed in addition to a BHRT but if you are around fifty years old or older, a BHRT may be an excellent option for you as it can treat other symptoms related to menopause or andropause as well as your thyroid condition. If you have concerns about your thyroid, you should speak with your doctor to develop the best course of action for you.Author: Gino Tutera MD, FACOG, is recognized internationally as a pioneer and leader in the field of bio identical hormone replacement therapy.

Seasonal mood disorder symptoms and hormonal symptoms can mimic one another.Many people find the hardest season change is from Fall to Winter (known as winter depression) as it is thought that shorter daylight time and less exposure to sunlight are factors along with the change(s) in the weather.Seasonal Mood disorder can affect people in many different ways, from extreme mood changes to depression, difficulty waking in the morning, nausea, lack of energy, feelings of hopelessness, anxiety and lack of interest, to name a few. It may start out mild and increase as time goes on.How does a person know they need to seek treatment for seasonal mood disorder?

In study after study, researchers have reported how the use of biologically identical estrogen and testosterone in bio-identical pellet hormone replacement therapy has positively impacted diseases such as osteoporosis, prostate cancer and HIV.How can you make sure you are working with a professional when seeking Pellet Hormone Replacement Therapy?&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ask questions are they a medical doctor? You would be surprised the number of groups that are not medical doctors who are doing this type of work.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ask about the compounding pharmacy they use SottoPelle has been using the same pharmacy for decades. Unfortunately many new groups were formed that were not as advanced or medically sound. Make sure you ask about the pharmacy.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Request information about speaking to a patient that has been doing Pellet Hormone Replacement Therapy. We know at our office there are hundreds of thrilled patients that would speak about their experience.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stay off of Google the worst place to find accurate medical information or advice is on Google. The problem is most people dont know what they are searching for and you will always find bad news most of which probably isnt true.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Know that Estradiol and Testosterone have been regulated by the FDA for Human Use.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Research options Pellet Therapy doesnt include creams or shots for an individual and each lot of hormone pellets contains pure hormone (99.89%) and a human fatty acid (0.2%) to bind them together (unlike other pellets that use synthetic fillers). The hormones are individually pressed or fused into very small solid cylinders or pellets. Estradiol pellets are a little bigger than a grain of riceapproximately 3 millimeters in diameter. Testosterone pellets are a bit larger than estradiol pellets at 4.5mm.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;Any reputable and professional medical professional will answer your questions and concerns make sure you are shopping around for a Doctor that has years of experience and history in HRT. Cheaper doesnt always mean better; experience is a must when dealing with your hormones.

This method of dosing hormone is without scientific basis, whether using biologically identical or synthetic hormones.The primary issue featured in the article is what biologically identical truly means.The only parameter the author focuses on is the biochemical structure.Biologically identical should only be attached to hormone replacement that satisfies the following parameters:1)A hormone that has the exact biochemical structure as the human hormone2)The hormone or hormones need to be replaced in the exact ratio in which the body produces the hormone to effect the maximum physiologic protection, (i.e., Estradiol to Estrone ratio of 2:1) the ratio the human body produces during the female luteal phase, which is the time a woman is in her most protected state.)3)The dose of hormone has to be dosed exactly for each patient, utilizing a dosing formula to produce a normal level of hormone that would be biologically identical for each patient and be protective.4)Most importantly, the hormone therapy cannot be biologically identical unless the delivery system utilized replicates the secretion pattern of the organ being replicated (i.e., ovary or testicle).Without fulfilling these parameters, the term biologically identical cannot be attached to a product.Which brings me to the appalling statement contained in the article that pellet therapy is dangerous and the example used is a group of medical clinics that were using an excellent therapy in a very incorrect manner. They were not properly supervised and they misused pellets.Would you term robotic surgery dangerous because a certain surgeon misused it, which resulted in serious complications?The answer is NO! The modality is good, the user was poorly trained.To state that pellets are dangerous demonstrates a lack of knowledge and research on the part of the author and her expert. The clinics referenced violated every standard of medical care and dosed everyone incorrectly.The clinic was incorrectly using an excellent form of hormone replacement, which became a recipe for disaster.In fact, pellet hormone replacement in contrast to the authors belief and expert opinion, is one of the most researched forms of hormone delivery, starting in 1939 by Dr. R. Greenblatt from the University of Georgia Medical College. And the clinics he established have been using pellet therapy continuously since 1937. Researchers such as Susan Davis MD, Margaret Thom MD, J. W. W. Studd, Dr. Craviato, Dr. D. Gambrell, Dr. Natrajan, Dr. Davelaar and Dr. Morris Notelovitz, all attest to the safety and efficacy of pellet hormone replacement with its ability to lower cholesterol, elevate HDL, normalize carbohydrate and insulin metabolism, reduce insulin resistance, improve myocardial function, reverse osteopenia and osteoporosis and proof that the use of pellet hormone replacement does not increase the incidence of the development of breast cancer.In fact, in our SottoPelle clinics, our incidence of breast cancer is 1:1000, compared to a 1:9for women not using hormones.The SottoPelle clinics and their doctors are strictly trained to use a proprietary, patent-pending formula to individualize the dose of estradiol and testosterone for each patient to effect a physiologic level of estradiol and testosterone for that particular patient. Our clinics are the only pellet replacement clinics that use this unique formula.Pellet hormone therapy is the only form of hormone replacement that satisfies all the parameters previously mentioned.1)SottoPelle Therapy correctly uses pellets that are manufactured to only contain estradiol and testosterone that are biologically identical in structure and are analyzed by an outside pharmacological lab for potency, purity, sterility and proper dissolution.2)The pellets are the only form of hormone replacement, which when properly dosed, replicates the protective ratio of estradiol to estrone ratio of 2:1 (Margaret Thom, MD 1983).3)The dosage has to be individualized to produce the physiologic levels of estradiol and testosterone necessary to produce the beneficial effects on the central nervous systems, cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and produce metabolic normality, only seen with pellets.4)The pellets are the only form of hormone delivery to reproduce the secretion pattern of the ovary and testicle.The pellets release of hormone is governed and controlled by heart rate and cardiac output, therefore, as long as the patients heart is beating and has a piece of a pellet in place, the secretion of hormone is continuous and will vary according to the patients needs.The body, therefore, controls the continuous release of the hormone, thereby allowing the body to increase or decrease the amount of hormone released, according to the bodys needs. No other form of hormone delivery (i.e., pills, patches, creams and gels, suppositories, rings or shots) allows the body to control the release of the hormone. Without the internal control of hormone release, the patient does not get a biologically identical secretion of hormone as with pellets.Without the continuous secretion of hormone, you cannot get the beneficial effect of the hormone and pellets are the only form of hormone delivery that delivers hormone in a biologically identical manner.In conclusion, pellet hormone replacement is the only true, biologically identical hormone replacement and according to the literature and the results seen in the tens of thousands of patients, both male and female, treated in our clinics over the past 22 years, is the only truly protective form of biologically identical hormone and is not dangerous.&amp;amp;nbsp;Gino Tutera, MD, FACOG"

"content": "&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Endocrine hormones are vital to health and well-being. It is critical that these chemicals exist in balance in order to perform as they are intended to. Without question, living with abnormally low levels of hormones, as occurs in menopause or andropause, upsets that balance and sends an open invitation to the physical, emotional and mental decline of aging and the chronic diseases that accompany it.The case for hormone replacement is compelling. Unlike the early days when HRT was basically an experiment designed to reduce menopause symptoms and backed by pharmaceutical marketing campaigns rather than long term studies, recent research is redefining the present-day approach.A large body of scientific evidence already exists substantiating the effects (both positive and negative) of todays HRT modalities. This important data will continue to accrue as current investigative outcomes are evaluated and more studies are undertaken.Many practitioners now recognize menopause and andropause for what they are&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;wellness issues&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;, and employ modalities that go beyond simply relieving symptoms. This more enlightened approach will help millions of peoplethose who wish to live longer and stay healthier as they ageto make better health choices.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THE STRONG CASE FOR HORMONE REPLACEMENT &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Endocrine hormones serve as the powerful chemical messengers that keep the body running in tiptop shape. They flow through the bloodstream around the clock, traveling to specific cells in order to orchestrate many of the bodys internal functions, including the behavior of vital organs. Even a small fluctuation in levels can cause big changes in cells or disturb the balance throughout the entire body. Too much or too little of a hormone can have someone suffering serious consequences.This is why the hormone deficiencies associated with menopause and andropause are so disruptive to a persons health. As hormone production subsides, a person is literally &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;wasting away on the inside&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;becoming frailer, losing muscle and bone mass, developing clogged arteries and losing mental acuity. The quality of life plummets at the same time the risk for many degenerative diseases skyrockets.Noted physicians Erika Schwartz and Kent Holtorf, published a seminal review of literature in 2008. In their article, they surveyed the outcomes of 267 studies which addressed the safety and efficacy aspects of various hormone replacement therapies. Their research literature was dated as far back as 1941 and centered on subjects ranging from the role played by conjugated and synthetic hormones in the increased risk of various types of cancer, to the positive impact of restored estradiol and testosterone levels on osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease when using bio-identicals. At end, Schwartz and Holtorf concluded unequivocally that hormone replacement has indeed been shown to be &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;an important tool in wellness and prevention&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;. Additionally, they found that &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;the type of hormone therapies&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;chosen&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;for patients is what makes the difference and must be carefully considered&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/shamburger\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/Temporary%20Internet%20Files\/Content.Outlook\/S90KZP02\/HORMONE%20REPLACEMENT%20THERAPY_Tutera_062513.docx#_ftn1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THE CONTROVERSY&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Its true that widespread disparity exists between hormone replacement physicians as to which hormones are the most important to replenish. If youve ever done an Internet search on the topic, you likely came up with no less than MILLIONS of websites suggesting a variety of solutions. These websites represent a wide range of opinions and endorsements; everything from organizations, medical groups and drug companies to HRT physicians, insurance companies and even celebrities. Youll find some recommending estrone or progesterone replacement as the panacea; others say its your DHEA, pregnenalone or human growth hormone (HGH) that need restoring; while still others prescribe testosterone and any or all of the three estrogens. And then there are the proponents of soy and herbals and so on. When so many are offering such varied solutions, its hard to imagine how patients can make sense of it.Bottom linethere really isnt an across the board consensus in the medical community, and despite the building evidence on bio-identicals and the importance of using the proper delivery method, there probably wont be for some time. However, there is a certain level of agreement since the most common replacement today generally consists of some form of estrogen combined with some form of progesterone. Testosterone is also at times included.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;THE KEY IS HORMONAL BALANCE&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Hormone replacement is complex, especially when the desired outcome is a return to homeostasis. You cannot randomly take any hormone or substance in any amount and expect to achieve hormonal balance. In order to regain this internal state, the method must be precise, available 24\/7 and based on replacing the essential missing hormones with those that are biologically identical.That perfectly describes the basis of &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br clear=&amp;quot;all&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;hr align=&amp;quot;left&amp;quot; size=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;33%&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/shamburger\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/Temporary%20Internet%20Files\/Content.Outlook\/S90KZP02\/HORMONE%20REPLACEMENT%20THERAPY_Tutera_062513.docx#_ftnref1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; Schwartz, E; Holtorf K (2008).

Simply hearing the words can spark a range of emotions, especially if your life or the life of someone you love has been changed by this all-too-common disease. According to the National Institutes of Health, one in eight women will be affected in their lifetime. Breast Cancer kills more women in the United States than any other cancer except lung cancer and the older a woman gets, the higher her risk of developing breast cancer. Those are sobering statistics, to be sure and to Dr. Gino Tutera, they are a call to action.&amp;amp;nbsp;Dr. Tutera is not only a respected physician, but a pioneer in the field of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT). He developed SottoPelle, a revolutionary method of delivering precisely the right balance of hormones when the body needs them most. And as a doctor who has tested the hormone levels of a countless number of patients, he knows a correlation when he sees one. Around age forty, there is an increase in fibrocystic disease of the breast, Dr. Tutera says. It coincides with women losing fifty percent of their testosterone production.&amp;amp;nbsp;Testosterone, long thought of as a mens hormone, is equally important to women in maintaining normal physiology. In fact, pre-menopausal women produce 300 milligrams of testosterone per day: a bucketful as opposed to a thimbleful. Still, says Dr. Tutera, it has been uniformly ignored. But for women at risk for or suffering from breast cancer, a restoration of normal testosterone levels can produce results that are nothing short of miraculous.&amp;amp;nbsp;Testosterone therapy helps decrease over-activity of cells in the breast, Dr. Tutera asserts. And if you decrease cell proliferation, you cut down on the occurrence of cystic disease. But if you think thats all testosterone replacement therapy can do, think again: this powerhouse also maintains bone density and prevents muscle loss, decreases cholesterol and triglycerides, lowers high blood pressure and decreases the risk of heart disease, and helps to provide an overall sense of wellbeing. Whats more, testosterone stimulates receptor sites in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes of the brain to stave off dementia and decrease the chances of developing Alzheimers disease. The proper level of testosterone benefits anyone, and can be a literal lifesaver for breast cancer patients who see not only a higher level of survivability, but a lower chance of recurrence.&amp;amp;nbsp;Breast cancer patients are uniformly subjected to the usual treatment of no hormones whatsoever, which actually shortens the life span, says Dr. Tutera. Through testosterone replacement with SottoPelle, we have the capability to help patients get their quality of life back. SottoPelle uses pellets that are comprised of the highest quality botanical ingredients, formulated to precisely match the hormones which naturally occur in the body, with no unnecessary fillers or artificial ingredients to hinder the assimilation process. This fully customized form of BHRT delivers the exact dosage of hormones that the body needs, efficiently recreating the natural physiological balance.&amp;amp;nbsp;No one wants to be the one woman in eight who is affected by breast cancer and certainly not more than once. Could testosterone replacement therapy with SottoPelle be the protection you need?&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Blog Author:&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; Gino Tutera MD, FACOG, is recognized internationally as a pioneer and leader in the field of bio identical hormone replacement therapy.

It weighs a merely 20 grams, or less than an ounce, and it is found in the neck beneath the Adams Apple. Despite its small size, it is one of the most important hormone-secreting organs in the body. Your thyroid provides a vital hormone to maintain and function the entire body. When this vital hormone is deficient, even in small amounts, it often results in a multitude of symptoms and conditions affecting every organ in your body.&amp;amp;nbsp;One of the important organs in the body that often undergoes changes before, during and after menopause is the thyroid gland. In fact, studies show that hypothyroidism is far more common in women, especially women of menopausal age or who has a family history of hypothyroidism. The following are a few basic facts about hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism affects 20 million Americans, or 1 in every 10 people. Hypothyroidism runs in families, specifically among other females in the family such as a mother, aunt, grandmother, or sister. Surveys demonstrate that hypothyroidism is up to 8x more common in women than men. By the time a woman is age 50, 1 out of every 10 to 12 women has some level of hypothyroidism and by age 60, it is as common as 1 out of every 5 or 6 women.&amp;amp;nbsp;The following list of symptoms is consistent with hypothyroidism. If you are suffering from any of these, please speak with your family physician regarding treatment. (These are only a few of the most common symptoms). Weakness Fatigue Constipation Weight gain Depression Paleness Dry flaky skin Hoarseness Abnormal menstrual periods Muscle pain Thin brittle hair and fingernails&amp;amp;nbsp;There are several blood tests that can be performed to accurately assess thyroid function. If your physician is attempting to determine your thyroid status, the blood test panel should consist of the following: TSH Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Total T 4 or T4 Total T3 Free T4 Free T3 Anti-TPO and Anti-Tg Antibodies&amp;amp;nbsp;If your healthcare provider has determined that you present clinically with hypothyroidism, a likely course of action will be to offer thyroid &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hormone replacement therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.

A recently published study from JAMA has been misinterpreted by the researchers and the media. They state the use of testosterone in men with significant heart disease increased the chance of heart attack and stroke by 26%, but the media failed to point out that the group of men in the study who did not have testosterone, had a 20% increase in heart attack and stroke therefore the true increase was only 6% not 26%. Unfortunately, the health of these men was poor. All of them had significant cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, and significant smoking history.This study was doomed from the start since the researchers only used the synthetic testosterone which has been shown to cause cardiac muscle abnormalities as well as vasospasm and vasoconstriction in the coronary arteries which undoubtedly would show an increase in heart attack and stroke, especially in this very sick population of men.As with the WHI in women, the study does not differentiate between the types of testosterone used, or the dosage given. The results were also skewed from the start by the sickness of the study group. In the literature, if the patient is given aromatizable testosterone, which acts like human testosterone, it results in dilatation of the coronary arteries as well as decreasing the total cholesterol and ldl in patients (Tenover, js ,J. Clin. Endo.Metab 1992, Wus.,Weng x, 1992 Chin Med Sci, Hamm, l. J.Clin. Endo. 1942, lesser ma, J.Clin. Endo. 1946 , Simon D. J. Clin. Endo. Metab. 1997 ). Common sense tells you that if men derive adverse effects from testosterone, then we should be seeing heart disease, stroke, and cardiac deaths in 30 year old men who carry the highest testosterone, but the opposite is true.If men would receive the identical testosterone that they make, then the protective effects would be restored. I have treated men for over 20 years with bio identical testosterone delivered by subcutaneous pellets and have only seen the beneficial effects of improved lipid parameters, increased exercise tolerance, improved mental skills and memory, better muscle mass, and greater quality of life. The patients I have treated with significant heart disease are still thriving and lead a healthy productive life.If there is anything to be taken away from this flawed study it is that we need to fund a study in which synthetic testosterone is compared to bio identical testosterone in a manner in which the patient receives individualized dosing according to calculations of certain variables such as age and physical size and others. Then and only then, will the medical community and the general population finally know that the use of biologically identical testosterone is the best and safest method of testosterone replacement."

Bio-Identical Hormone Pellet Therapy, The SottoPelle Method is the superior choice for any menopause symptoms. Peri-menopause typically begins when a woman is in her 40s and can average 4 to 8 years. Menopause occurs roughly in women their early 50s. Every year it is estimated that 1.3 million women are expected to reach menopause. Menopause is more than just a list of symptoms (though we outline symptoms below)or not having a period for a year. The clinical definition that SottoPelle uses for diagnosis is quite simply stated: A woman is in menopause when the level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a pituitary hormone, reaches and stays above a level greater than 23 miu\/ml whether she is menstruating or not menstruating.&amp;amp;nbsp;Watch for these signs this Holiday Season.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Signs and Symptoms of Menopause:&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hot flashes&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Severe sweating can happen both day and night&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Insomnia&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vaginal dryness&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vaginal discomfort&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Irritability&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Loss of memory or fuzzy thinking&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Cold sweats&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Irregular periods&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Anxiety&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Mood swings&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Headaches&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sadness&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Dont let Menopause ruin your holidays.

"content": "Our fourth article in our hormone and holidays series focuses on men. Often, during a hectic holiday season, men will suffer in silence with baffling symptoms they dont understand. As men age, certain symptoms may be signs of hormone imbalance due to andropause. Its important to remind men that they can seek help and that Bio-Identical Hormone Pellet Therapy, The SottoPelle Method can help them.The following are six common signs we have visited before on our Blog but a reminder is so crucial during the chaotic days and nights over the Holidays. The below could indicate a hormonal deficiency.1. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Thinning of Hair &amp;amp;amp; Loss of Body Hair&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Decreased testosterone levels leads to loss of scalp and body hair because an imbalance of testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exists. DHT inhibits the growth of new hair cells and hair cells are not replaced after they fall out when DHT activity is higher than testosterone activity.2. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Weight Gain&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Weight gain is commonly reported by men during andropause. The decrease in testosterone levels leads to higher insulin and cortisol levels. When men have high cortisol levels, their bodies can increase the production of fat cells and increases appetite. High levels of insulin and cortisol also decreases metabolism and continues to decrease testosterone. The combination of these effects leads to weight gain.3. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Decreased Libido&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;As energy decreases with lower testosterone levels, mens sex drive often follows. The libido is considered highly dependent on hormone levels and is affected by the changes in hormones as men enter andropause. The loss of energy and strength during this time in a mans life also plays into a lowered libido, as does less stimulation of the libido center in the brain.4. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Trouble sleeping&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Low testosterone and heightened cortisol levels can lead to sleep apnea. Because human growth hormones are made during the first ninety minutes of sleep, interrupted sleep leads to the disruption of hormone production. When sleep is interrupted it can lead to worsened fatigue and insomnia, as well as, reduce insulin sensitivity.5. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Depression&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Depression is a common side effect of decreased testosterone. Decreased testosterone leads to lower serotonin levels in the brain. Often times, men are not accustomed to being vocal about their emotions, but it is important for them to share these feelings with a medical professional as it may be a symptom of low testosterone.6. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Muscle Loss&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Testosterone is a major component in the production of strong muscles in men. As the testosterone decreases in men, their muscle strength can also decrease as they lose energy and their bodies begin turning muscle fibers into fat.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Remember: Dont &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;try to &amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;fight these symptoms yourself. The great gift of the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;SottoPelle Therapy&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; can have you on your way to looking and feeling young again. You deserve to get the most out of life and enjoy your Holidays.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Blog Author:&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; Gino Tutera MD, FACOG, is recognized internationally as a pioneer and leader in the field of bio identical hormone replacement therapy and a published author of three books and articles in medical journals.

"content": "Parkinsons disease strikes nearly 60,000 Americans every year, making even the most minor daily tasks a major challenge for many people. For 54-year-old Mike Puzzi, the first troubling symptoms of Parkinsons surfaced in 2010, taking a toll on both his physical health and his psychological outlook.But since June, the Arizona native has been on a pioneering new treatment, called SottoPelle Hormone Pellet Therapy. Developed by Scottsdale physician Gino Tutera, M.D., the therapy uses bio-identical hormones, delivered through implants placed under the skin, to ease the symptoms of Parkinsons and slow its progression.Since starting treatment, Puzzi tells Newsmax Health, his health and psychological outlook have improved dramatically and his symptoms are largely under control.&amp;quot;It was just an unbelievable change in my life,&amp;quot; says Puzzi, of the impact of the therapy. &amp;quot;Ive cut my medicine down from eight pills a day to four pills a day. It made a world of difference in my quality of life and everything in my world today. I wouldnt know what to do without the pellets.&amp;quot;Story continues below video.&amp;amp;nbsp;Dr. Tutera explains that the painless treatment method involves inserting a rice-sized pellet under the patients hip which delivers a precise dose of hormones. Unlike other therapies that take a &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; method, SottoPelle is customized for each patient, based on their individual hormonal deficiencies. Once in place, the pellets work with the patients own bodily functions and other medications to release just the right levels of hormones necessary to maintain levels of key brain chemicals, such as dopamine, which are depleted in Parkinsons patients.&amp;quot;Hormone therapy has been used in the past, and theres documentation in the literature that it has been beneficial, but the results have been so spotty because of the fact that they were always using other forms of delivering the hormones, usually pills, for the most part,&amp;quot; Dr. Tutera explains.But with SottoPelle therapy, the patients heart rate and blood flow govern the release of hormones from the pellets implanted under the skin.&amp;quot;It allows the body to control the release of the hormone, and therefore as long as your hearts beating and you have pellets in place, youre getting a continual flow of hormone then gives the brain the capability of increasing dopamine production and other neurotransmitters, serotonin, endorphins all of which are beneficial to the Parkinsons patient,&amp;quot; he tells Newsmax.In addition, testosterone therapy helps build muscle, allowing for greater capacity for exercise, better physical endurance, and faster recovery from exercise or physical therapy.In patients like Puzzi, Dr. Tutera has seen vast improvements, allowing many to cut back on their medicine.&amp;quot;This is not a cure, he notes, but its a really a great adjunctive therapy to use to to forestall the progression of the disease. As I told Mike, if we dont get any better than where you are now, the quality of life that you have is so far superior to what you had before you got pellets.&amp;quot;Im markedly excited about maybe having these patients get to the point where they only need minimal medication or hopefully no medications whatsoever.&amp;quot;Although the Food and Drug Administration has traditionally taken a dim view of bio-identical hormones, Dr. Tutera says he has seen tremendous progress in his patients who have received the treatment.Puzzi, who has four daughters and nine grandchildren with his wife of 25 years, says he first noticed symptoms of Parkinsons in 2010, but wasnt formally diagnosed until this year. His wife had been going to Dr. Tuteras clinic for years, so when he read about the SottoPelle therapy in a fitness magazine, he decided to give it a try.&amp;quot;I received my first pellets in June and my second set in October,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;The pellets have helped me in many ways.&amp;quot;Today, he says he has more energy, goes to the gym regularly without a problem, and has noticed improvements in his memory, concentration, sleep, and mobility. In addition, hes reduced his medication from eight pills a day to three or four and confides that there have been some unexpected developments in other areas of his life.&amp;quot;My libido has gone through the roof which has improved my relationship with my wife,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;My wife also says I am basically a happier, easy going, and my patience is much, much better.&amp;quot;The joke at work is everyone is going to pitch in to pay for my pellets because Im more patient. All in all I feel better; Im happier and feel like I can conquer this life.&amp;quot;By Nick TateOriginally posted by Newsmax.com.

Cortisol is the hormone commonly related to stress and during the holidays stress is felt by many. Cortisol helps the body use sugar and fat for energy. As levels rise, the rate of this function slows down; as a result, metabolism also slows. As you age, your muscle mass decreases which slows the rate that your body can use calories. This loss combined with high cortisol levels make it difficult not to gain weight as you age.The holiday season is known for its abundance of sweets and piles of food. Its difficult to find a holiday recipe that doesnt have a pound of butter and sugar so how are you expected to avoid the excess weight gain during this time of year?&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Exercise&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; - Its difficult during the most wonderful time of year to get to the gym but doing just that could help you reduce some of that holiday stress. While you exercise, endorphins are released in your brain that make you feel better. Allowing yourself to focus on one task can help you release stress and feel refreshed. Research has also shown that regular exercise can help improve self-confidence and anxiety making the holiday season a more important time than ever to stick to an exercise routine or start one!&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Drink Water &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;- While youre enjoying your meal, put down the holiday cocktail and help yourself to a glass of water. You will avoid drinking empty calories and providing your body with hydration that can help you feel full faster.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Portion Control&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; - Instead of filling your plate up with mountains of your favorite holiday treats, limit yourself to small portions of them. If you still think you are hungry after you finish, try waiting fifteen minutes before getting seconds to allow your brain to register that you have already eaten.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Bio-Identical Hormone Pellet Therapy - &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;The SottoPelle Method helps the body release hormone when it is needed and decrease it when requiring less 24\/7 improving a vast number of symptoms related to andropause and menopause. Some symptoms the SottoPelle Method helps improve are anxiety, depression, fatigue, difficulty losing weight, increased body fat, and carbohydrate cravings. The holidays seem synonymous with many of these symptoms so speak to your doctor about how SottoPelle can help you.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Enjoy Yourself&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; The holidays are a chance for many to reconnect with friends and family. Instead of obsessing over calories, spend your time cherishing your loved ones and counting the blessings the year has brought you.

As you aged, the anticipation may have dwindled listening for reindeer hoots, as you find yourself unable to fall asleep. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;As men and women age, their testosterone and estrogen levels naturally decrease. This affects your body in a number of ways. Unfortunately, one of these ways is an increase in difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Insomnia is no longer limited to Christmas Eve. With menopause and andropause, insomnia can affect your sleep on a nightly basis. There are a number of ways that we can help you to decrease the negative effects of this sleeping disorder.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;SottoPelle Hormone Replacement Therapy &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;SottoPelle differs from creams by using your internal system to regulate what your body knows it needs and when.

By eliminating caffeine consumption after 12 pm, it can help make falling asleep a little easier. Alcohol may make you feel drowsy and help you fall asleep, but it can leave you with a headache the next morning. Alcohol can also cause you to reawake during the middle of the night and make it more difficult to fall back asleep.

Two-thirds of women enduring menopause report forgetfulness. This is oft&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;en associated with growing older but new findings suggest there may be a solution. During the past few years, multiple studies have been conducted on memory loss in women. A new study offers renewed hope to women who are combating these exasperating symptoms daily.The University of Southern California has recently released a study they conducted revealing that estrogen may protect women who are growing older from the effects of stress and memory loss. During the five year study, they found that postmenopausal women with estrogen replacement therapy performed better under stress than those with low estrogen levels. They also found that women with higher estrogen levels had lower surges of cortisol, the hormone referred to as the stress hormone. These findings caused researchers to conclude that estrogen may be a natural barrier against stress.SottoPelle therapy differs from creams by using your internal system to regulate what your body knows it needs and when.

Then look into workouts you can do in the comfort of your own home when you cant make it in. Youll still be staying fit but you wont be as stressed on those days that you cant get there. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Keep Hormones Balanced&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;It isnt easy to try your hardest when you dont feel like yourself.

They can stir up trouble in adults with very different results. As teenagers, you may remember people blaming hormones for your attraction to someone, a smattering of pimples on your face or for overreacting about something. Hopefully you experience a bit of a respite in adulthood from those troublesome hormones. Chances are they can start difficulties again. Are you tired at the end of the day? Are you tossing and turning instead of sleeping? Do you have cold sweats even though your room is nice and warm. Is the room too warm for you while others are freezing? Do you jump at others for no reason? SottoPelle works with your body to bring back your energy and keep your hormones in balance. Each dose is individualized for you!

"content": "&amp;amp;nbsp;Valentines Day is approaching rapidly and everywhere we look we are flooded with romantic ideals from the grocery aisles to television commercials. Year after year it is the same message. Love is in the air. But are you in love? Are you experiencing a noticeable reduction in your sexual desire? This is a common occurrence in men as they age and is seldom discussed for fear of embarrassment by either party.As men age, their testosterone levels decrease. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Mens Low T Symptoms&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=599&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lower testosterone levels&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; can lead to a lower libido or sex drive. They can also lead to erectile dysfunction. Testosterone stimulates nerves in the brain, and with less testosterone there is less stimulation. This leads to a lower libido. Low testosterone also can mean less energy and more fatigue. Neither of these make for a pleasing time in the bedroom. This often puts a strain on relationships and marriages that carries into other parts of their lives.If you have found yourself experiencing any of these symptoms, there is a significant possibility that you may have andropause. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Andropause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; is the decrease of testosterone in men, essentially the male version of menopause. It generally occurs in men ages 44 to 55 years old. Without treatment, men go through a variety of symptoms at this time. They can have mood swings, loss of mental focus, develop osteoporosis, decreased endurance, and sleep disturbances, to name only a few symptoms.SottoPelle has been diagnosing and treating men with &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Andropause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; for years.

Hormones effect you in such different ways than they did when your were a teen, yet they still play a role in your sex life.Menopausal women complain about lacking energy. While this is a difficult thing to combat on a daily basis, it often makes sex less desirable. After a long day, it is challenging for women, going through menopause, to find the energy or desire to engage in sexual activities. Menopause tends to decrease a womans libido and cause vaginal dryness. Vaginal dryness can make intercourse painful for women.While these are often the most common problems associated with sexual and romantic desire as women grow older, there are unfortunately more with the most common being: Hot flashes and Night Sweats. These symptoms can also play a role in how women respond to sex. Weight gain associated with menopause can make a woman feel less attractive and influence her confidence in the bedroom.There is a bright side to all these unromantic symptoms. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle Therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; has crafted a favorable treatment method for dealing with menopausal symptoms.

"content": "Have you ever wondered who has a stronger desire for sex? Mens sex drives are stronger and straightforward than womens. Womens sex drives are weaker and more susceptible to be influenced by external and internal factors.Women connect with emotions and their libidos are harder to recognize. Emotional connection is considered a component of sexual desire for women whereas that bears little to no recognition in men in relation to their sex drive. Environment and context also play into a womans desire for sex. If the mood or place is not to their liking they may not be willing to engage in sex. Menopause tends to decrease a womans libido and cause vaginal dryness. Vaginal dryness can make intercourse painful for women and decrease their desire for it as well.The average male thinks about sex more than about seventy-five percent of women. Men desire sex throughout an entire relationship. When aroused, men are both physically and mentally ready. This is not always the case for women. Although they may be physically ready that can also experience mental unpreparedness. Some researchers believe this is in part to them being more susceptible to dealing with the results of sex, such as pregnancy. On the other hand, men have an urge to reproduce. Women are often more cautious about who they engage in sex with than men.As men age, their testosterone levels decrease. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Mens Low T Symptoms&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=599&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lower testosterone levels&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; can lead to a lower libido or sex drive.

"content": "&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;As we have noted in past blogs this past month, a decreased interest in sex as we age is a common occurrence that couples face. We have outlined how the effects hormones have on your body as it change as you get older. Especially note how they affect men and women differently.Combating these imperceptible biochemicals that run through your body constantly seems like an impossible task and it may be easy to put the weight of the consequences on yourself. It is of utmost importance to understand how large of a role hormones play in your love life. Most likely it is not you or your partners fault if either of you have experienced a decreased libido. You should look at your situation from a rational perspective instead of from an emotional one, which is easier said than done.At SottoPelle, we have couples that approach us about concerns they have with their romantic lives. By assisting them in restoring hormone equilibrium they often report an increased libido and desire for sex. This in turn helps their relationship grow stronger. Hormones will forever be part of our lives and at times we may have to find ways to keep them in proper balance. The &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle Method&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; assists with just that.Mahatma Gandhi said, Where there is love, there is life.

Simply stated, the significance of this is clear. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Do not give synthetic testosterone to individuals who are at high risk for heart attack or stroke!&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The journal evidence shows in studies by Zmuda (Am J. of Card , Atherosclerosis), Wu (J Chin Med), Weyrich and others that the use of an aromatizable testosterone does not have the potential to induce coronary spasm and myocardial damage.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt; &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Synthetic testosterone products, on the other hand, do not aromatize and do have the ability to induce coronary spasm and myocardial damage.&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Bioidentical testosterone does aromatize&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt; and has been shown to assist in retaining the ability of the coronary arteries to dilate and remain pliable. &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Bioidentical testosterone in pellet form&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; has shown that it increases HDL, reduces LDL, and total cholesterol.&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Finally, these researchers should have their feet held to the fire for placing these sick patients at risk and for giving those of us who practice good common sense medicine and utilize bioidentical testosterone a bad name.&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Legal vultures bring it on.

And theres no reason to be afraid of testosterone. This hormone has been central to his well-being his entire life. It sustains many body functions beyond sexual and reproductive health. Normal, physiologic levels of testosterone support proper bone density, muscle mass, fat distribution, cognitive performance, prostate health, production of red blood cells, a normal lipid profile and more. At the same time, low testosterone levels are linked to depression, fatigue, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimers, high blood pressure and other ailments. Deficiency has likewise been shown to increase the risk of coronary heart disease as well as all-cause and cardiac mortality.&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/Trey%20Smith\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/INetCache\/Content.Outlook\/562JL4JZ\/TESTOSTERONE%20LETTER%20DR%20T%20v1.docx#_ftn2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/Trey%20Smith\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/INetCache\/Content.Outlook\/562JL4JZ\/TESTOSTERONE%20LETTER%20DR%20T%20v1.docx#_ftn3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;\/sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/Trey%20Smith\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/INetCache\/Content.Outlook\/562JL4JZ\/TESTOSTERONE%20LETTER%20DR%20T%20v1.docx#_ftn4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;Mounting evidence indicates that maintaining normal testosterone levels can be a key factor in healthy aging. Thats why safe and effective testosterone replacement is vital.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;KNOW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SYNTHETIC AND BIOIDENTICAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Before signing on for HRT, every man should understand the distinction between human, synthetic and bioidentical hormones.n Human testosterone is created in the testes of a man, and in the ovaries of a woman.n Synthetic testosterone is a pharmaceutical drug. It does not match human hormone and cannot replicate every function of human testosterone. This synthetic drug poses many health risks, especially when used in pill, injection, gel, or cream form and in high dosages.n Biologically identical testosterone, on the other hand, exactly matches human hormone on a molecular basis. It can thus address all of the tasks of human testosterone, especially when used in pellet implant form. When properly administered, pellet implants can restore testosterone to the beneficial physiologic levels needed to support optimum health.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;CHOSE SOTTOPELLE&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt; FOR SAFE &amp;amp;amp; EFFECTIVE BIOIDENTICAL TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT &amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;1) The Goal -To restore healthful physiologic hormone levels2) The Hormones -Biologically identical hormones the body recognizes, NOT synthetic drugs3) The Dosage -Consistent, low dose of hormone4) The Method -Pellet delivery system using the bloodstream works 24\/7 for months at a time5) The Experts -We understand endocrinology and how to return healthful hormone levels in a way the body recognizes and can work with&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;hr align=&amp;quot;left&amp;quot; size=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;33%&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/Trey%20Smith\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/INetCache\/Content.Outlook\/562JL4JZ\/TESTOSTERONE%20LETTER%20DR%20T%20v1.docx#_ftnref1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; Rebecca Vigen. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Association of Testosterone Therapy With Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in Men With Low Testosterone Levels&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;JAMA&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;, 2013; 310 (17): 1829 DOI: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1001\/jama.2013.280386&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;10.1001\/jama.2013.280386&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;file:\/\/\/C:\/Users\/Trey%20Smith\/AppData\/Local\/Microsoft\/Windows\/INetCache\/Content.Outlook\/562JL4JZ\/TESTOSTERONE%20LETTER%20DR%20T%20v1.docx#_ftnref2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=Miner%20MM%5BAuthor%5D&amp;amp;amp;cauthor=true&amp;amp;amp;cauthor_uid=17343664&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Miner MM&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;\/sup&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=Seftel%20AD%5BAuthor%5D&amp;amp;amp;cauthor=true&amp;amp;amp;cauthor_uid=17343664&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Seftel AD&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.

Hormone changes, stress and a busy lifestyle can dramatically increase the effects fatigue has on your life and your body. Extreme fatigue during menopause is sometimes called crashing fatigue. This symptom is sometimes accompanied by feelings of overwhelming exhaustion, weakness and a low level of energy. This crashing fatigue is caused by hormonal imbalance.&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exercise is a great way to boost your energy. Walking for twenty minutes can increase your energy level and improve your mental outlook.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Drinking water is recommended to combat fatigue. Dehydration can decrease alertness andconcentration.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Sometimes the solution could be as simple as going to bed at an earlier time. Fatigue can often be brought on or increased by lack of sleep. Sleeping longer can help you have more energy during the day.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Fatigue can also be a sign of more serious illnesses such as anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperthryroidism, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, liver disease, coronary artery disease, or another medical problem. It is sometimes difficult to tell whether the fatigue a woman is experiencing is due to menopause or one of these or any other secondary symptom. Night sweats and sleep disturbances, may also be causing the fatigue.SottoPelle Therapy has crafted a beneficial treatment method for dealing with menopausal symptoms. SottoPelle helps you by balancing your hormone levels and helping you combat menopausal fatigue.

"description": "",
"content": "Dear HysterSisters,I am a fellow &amp;quot;Hyster-sister&amp;quot; who relied on your site for many great resources when I was facing a hysterectomy in 2009. You also asked me to serve on a panel of speakers following my surgery in 2010 to assist other women who were facing similar procedures and help to answer their questions. I was happy to do so and help my fellow Hyster-sisters, as they helped me.However, I am deeply concerned, as a longtime investigative medical reporter specializing in womens health, to see that you are promoting the consideration and possible use of the very type of dangerous pharmaceuticals journalists like myself are working hard to expose for the sake of safeguarding womens health and human health in general.This is a very questionable drug whose ominous side-effects are yet to be thoroughly examined and scientifically analyzed. Remember, it took the medical industry many years before the dangers of drugs like Premarin and Prempro were finally fully realized. By that time, it was too late for the countless women suffering from cancer, heart disease and other disastrous side effects.Now we have a medication here for which you have to highlight suicidal side effects in a distinct and separate box. Oh boy, here we go again.Wake up, dear Hyster-sisters, before its too late. Or perhaps Noven Therapeutics is paying you to promote their toxic wares on your site? If so, shame on you for selling out womens health for 20 pieces of gold. If not, then shame on you not fully examining what you are posting in your website affiliations and promotions.Perhaps if you are going to use your site to allegedly help women while promoting drugs at the same time, you should be presenting ALL the options. And that includes safe, genuinely natural, NON-PHARMACEUTICAL approaches too.How about posting info about SottoPelle, the ONLY scientifically proven, medically safe and effective means of bio-identical hormone support. Based on years of research, it represents a must for any women undergoing a hysterectomy. It is also the approach that sustained me during and after my surgery as it does to this very day, which is fully explained in the link to my full investigative health report and doctor interview below.Contrary to public and even medical misinformation about hormones, the dangerous pharmaceutical ones with all the negative side effects are recent newcomers in the broad spectrum of womens reproductive health. The safe, natural bio-identical kind have been with us over 75 years.Sadly, sites such as yours as well as the media fail to distinguish that there are different types of hormones. Not all hormones are bad and not all of them have side effects. Yet every woman undergoing hysterectomy must consider some form of natural bio-identical hormone supplementation if she is to maintain her basic health and functioning, without depression, fatigue, loss of libido, and so on.In January 2010, less than one month after my hysterectomy, I wrote an in-depth investigative medical article about a 100% completely natural and safe alternative for women that has been around since the 1930s and is backed by numerous medical studies.I asked you to consider posting my story, which I wrote without income because I was not paid to write it, for the sake of womens health and so my fellow Hyster-Sisters could make their own educated decisions for themselves. You chose not to... yet now you post info for dangerous drugs. This leads me to question who and what lurks behind your website.I submit this article to you once again, nearly 4 years later, again for the sake of womens health, in addition to another one I wrote last year that details the proven safe science behind this non-pharmaceutical approach. Again, no one paid me to write these and I didnt accept 20 pieces of gold from some drug company to promote them. And Im not seeking any compensation now. My reward is knowing that one more woman will be spared a life free from unnecessary misery.I thank you in advance for presenting all the facts on this critical health issue for all our Hyster-sisters and to reconsider your promotion of drugs with suicidal and other toxic side effects. As a woman, I am extremely dismayed; as a medical journalist, I am terribly disgusted; and as a Hyster-sister, I am deeply disappointed.&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/sedonaobserver.com\/Hormones_HealthCare.htm&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/sedonaobserver.com\/Hormones_HealthCare.htm&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; - The Truth about Hormones&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/sedonaobserver.com\/SottoPelle.htm&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/sedonaobserver.com\/SottoPelle.htm&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; - The Science of Bio-Identical Hormone TherapySincerely in good health,&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Catherine J.

"content": "&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;Spring is usually thought of as a time for new beginnings and fresh starts. Flowers bloom as does Love. As spring is in the air so is love. As couples age, some might find their love life feels as its beginning to taper off. This is usually a result of imbalanced hormones and the side effects they create.When women age&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt; their estrogen levels often decrease resulting in lack of energy, vaginal dryness, poor cognitive function and decreased libido. All of these issues cause women not to be aroused in the bedroom and can put a strain on their relationship. The loss of &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Estrogen&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1446&amp;quot;&amp;gt;estrogen&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; alone can cause many of these changes. It generally produces vaginal atrophy and thinning of the vaginal wall, which can make intercourse painful; a decrease in urine pH can sometimes create vaginal itching or an unpleasant discharge. Cystitis is common, which can mimic a urinary tract infection and lead to frequency of urination, urgency and incontinence. Loss of pelvic tone occurs and may produce a uterine or bladder prolapse, a condition where these organs bulge at the vaginal opening. This often must be corrected surgically. Wheres the love in the bedroom when this happens to us women?Usually when people think of older adults with unbalanced hormones, a menopausal woman comes to mind. But we know full well that men also experience hormonal changes as they age. For men, their &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; decreases and causes mood swings, decreased energy, increase in body fat and a harder time getting in shape. Men also experience a decrease in libido due to lowered testosterone levels. Theres no question that a mans testosterone is his most vital hormone. Take it away and his well-being goes with it. Besides making &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;a man a man&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;, its central to good health and provides the foundation for many of the bodys functions. For instance, testosterone directly affects muscle development, bone density, sexual and reproductive function; supports a healthy supply of red blood cells and a normal lipid profile; and maintains many different parts of the brain including cognitive function, moods, depression, and energy levels. Additionally, normal testosterone production aids in bone growth and creates positive anabolic effects that help with metabolism of salts and fluid balance as well as making the skin more vascular and less fatty.No wonder andropause can land such a devastating blow.The best news is that the &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle Method&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; can help you and your loved one regain the spark you once had.

"content": "Im writing to you in regards to FDA and Docket NO. FDA-2013-N-1523.President Obama passed legislation to protect the citizens from not receiving medical treatment, whether they are men or women. So now everyone can buy insurance regardless of their pre-existing condition. This is great work. On the other hand some are trying to pass legislation to diminish the quality of medicine by making it illegal to compound medicine. The Hormone Replacement Therapy is essential to my health and I have benefited from it. As a consumer, a citizen, I ask the FDA to please to allow the compounding of the BHRT. Millions of women and depend on it to protect themselves from illness. What good does it make to have insurance, but then we dont have the right medicine? I tried the patch, but it does not work for me. I had bad side effects from it. The only thing that works for me is the BHRT.I was on the patch, I was very sick, very weak, my heart trembled, I had high blood pressure, and I could barely function; within 12 hours after receiving the bioidentical hormone therapy, I came back to life. My cholesterol level is back to normal level, my blood pressure is normal now and I feel good all over my body. This is an effective and necessary treatment for me. The bio identical hormone therapy BHRT is very effective in balancing my hormones, not just estrogen but also testosterone. This hormonal balance is super, I have not had to see a doctor since I have been on BHRT and my recent lab blood test results are all within range and my heart (EKG) is normal. Please, please allow the preparation-compounding of bio idential hormones. President Obama has a common sense and practical approach concerning the health issues , so in that spirit I ask you to allow the compounding of bio identical hormones. Oprah Winfrey is using bio identical hormones and she loves it. She gave interviews on that.The FDA can make a difference in the life of millions of people, by allowing Bio Identical Hormone Therapy (BHRT) on the allowed Bulk Drug Substances list (FDA and Docket NO. FDA-2013-N-1523.I thank you for taking the time to read my comment and I hope that you will respond positively to my request.Respectfully,Leah"

Crashing fatigue is when you feel extreme exhaustion and complete lack of energy. This often goes away with enough sleep, hydration and rest. Other women begin to experience night sweats during&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;. These are uncomfortable experiences that interrupt sleep and cause restless nights. Men also may suffer from these as they go through&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;. These night sweats, also known as sleep hyperhidrosis, are usually described as sever hot flashes that occur in the middle of the night.Keeping stress levels low can help reduce the chance of wearing yourself down. Take some time each day to relax and maybe do some yoga. Yoga and other daily exercises have been shown to reduce stress levels and promote energy.

"content": "&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;The most abundant mineral in the human body is calcium. It accounts for 1-2% of an adult humans body weight. 99% of calcium is stored in the bones and teeth with the remaining 1% located in the blood, muscles and tissue. Calcium is an essential element for maintaining and building strong bones.Additionally, this mineral is needed for the heart, muscles and nerves to function properly. Calcium helps blood vessels and muscles contract and expand. It helps send messages through the nervous system and to secrete hormones and enzymes. Vitamin D is needed for the body to absorb calcium. Although not definitive, some studies suggest calcium and vitamin D may protect against cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.Low calcium levels can lead to health problems such as low bone mass, a risk factor for osteoporosis. On the other hand, too much calcium may increase the risk of kidney stones, constipation, impaired absorption of iron, magnesium and zinc, and calcium buildup in your blood vessels. Excess calcium in the bloodstream can lead to a condition known as hypercalcemia.Women ages nineteen to fifty years old should take in 1,000 mg to 2,500 mg of calcium daily. Women over the age of fifty should take in 1,200 mg to 2,000 mg of calcium daily. Cows milk, orange juice, kale, collard greens, and yogurt are excellent sources of calcium. Consuming calcium rich foods can also ease menopausal symptoms!&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Blog Author:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Gino Tutera, M.D., F.A.C.O.G.&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=39&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Gino Tutera MD, FACOG&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;, is recognized internationally as a pioneer and leader in the field of&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=2&amp;quot;&amp;gt; bio identical hormone replacement therapy.&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; He currently is practicing seeing patients for over thirty years and specializing in natural hormone therapy.

"content": "When understanding what breast health is, it is important to understand what is normal and what is not. Doctors encourage women to practice doing regular breast self-exams. The menstrual cycle can change the sensitivity and texture of breasts and understanding this helps you know when something is different or abnormal. Your age, hormone levels and medication may cause changes in your breasts.The stoppage of the study called the Womens Health Initiative (W.H.I.) due to increasing rates of breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease, caused shock waves in our society. This study demonstrated that oral conjugated estrogen, estrogen removed from horse urine, such as Premarin, especially when coupled with synthetic progesterone (i.e: Premarin, Provera, Prempro, Premphase) caused a slight increase in the rate of breast cancer cases developing in the study group. The problem with this study in the conclusion reached was that all estrogen caused the same problems. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is simply illogical&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;. Oral conjugated estrogen (Premarin, etc) is horse estrogen and is as different from human &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Estrogen&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1446&amp;quot;&amp;gt;estrogen&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; as night is to day. The logic that oral estrogen (Premarin) causes an increase in breast cancer therefore all estrogen does the same is hogwash. This would be comparable to saying that because one cosmetic company produces a bad mascara that all mascaras are bad for you. This is not logical. All estrogen is not the same. The estrogen therapy promoted in this book is &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Bio-Identical Hormones&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=268&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bio-identical&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;. Which means it is identical to that which the human body produces, and does not cause any of the problems that horse or synthetic estrogen may cause.The body makes three different &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Estrogen&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1446&amp;quot;&amp;gt;estrogens&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;: estrone, estradiol and estriol. The major estrogen in a woman is estradiol. In fact, it is produced in amounts twice as great as the levels of estrone in the blood. This ratio of estradiol to estrone normally is 2:1. To normally function a womens body has to have this ratio of estrogens present. If the ratio is changed, it would cause too much estrone to be made, and this estrogen is a very strong breast stimulator. One reason women complain of breast tenderness while on oral estrogens is because all oral estrogens do not keep the normal ratio of estradiol to estrone at 2:1. In fact the ratio seen with Premarin and all tablets containing conjugated estrogens is a complete reversals of this ratio to 1:2. The oral estradiol (i.e. Estrace) tablets usually make the normal ratio of 2:1 change to 1:1. This identical ratio is also seen with the estradiol used in all the estrogen patches. The only form of estrogen therapy that reproduces the normal ratio of estrogens in the body are the type used in SottoPelle therapy (estradiol pellets). Dr. M.Thom in her articles published in 1980 and 1981 in the British Journal of Medicine and British Journal of OB\/GYN demonstrated this very elegantly.A few comments regarding estriol. Estriol has been touted as an estrogen that does not cause breast cancer. The evidence for this is faulty. The amount of estriol used in these studies was so low that the estrogen level in the blood would be very low. If enough estriol is given to produce a relief of symptoms of the &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; such as vaginal dryness and changing of hot flashes, the dosage would be 2 to 4 times the amount used in these studies. In fact any estrogen given in doses that equal the doses used in these studies would also show no increase in the incidence of breast cancer.This leads to only one conclusion. Give women the estrogen the body uses commonly, estradiol. Furthermore, recreate the normal ratio of estradiol to the other estrogens, 2:1. and remember the only form of estrogen replacement therapy that can do all of this is biologically identical estradiol pellets that&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt; SottoPelle Therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; uses and its SottoPelle Nutritional Supplements.In addition to self-exams, it is also important to get regular screenings and diagnostic tests such as clinical breast exams, breast ultrasounds and mammograms and or thermagrams. Knowledge is powerful. It is important to talk to your primary care physician if you have concerns about breast changes or breast health. Taking care of yourself is a necessity and the key to that is arming yourself with all the information you can. The first year survival rate for breast cancer is above ninety percent when caught early and because one in eight US women will develop breast cancer, understanding breast health is vital.While the cause is still unknown some steps standout for breast cancer prevention.

"content": "&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; is mans most important hormone. It is essential to his vitality, his sex life, his physical well-being and his outlook. All these things balance out with an accurate reception of testosterone.Testosterone is a steroid hormone thats vital to optimal health in both men and women. There is strong evidence linking testosterone directly to many body functions including: muscle development, fat levels, bone mass, brain functions such as moods, depression, memory and cognitive performance, energy levels, ability to achieve orgasm, heart health and ability to sleep, among many other things.Research has shown that human testosterone has many important functions in addition to enhancing the libido. It augments bone strength, density and the ability of bone to repair itself. Testosterone also improves mood and heightens the feeling of well-being; increases muscle strength and mass; thickens the skin; promotes optimal brain function and more.If testosterone produces all of these beneficial effects, it only makes sense that when it diminishes significantly, as it does in the aging male and female, the health and welfare of the individual also weakens. There is now a great deal of medical literature supporting this conclusion, with many new research studies underway. Current literature already corroborates that low levels of testosterone are directly linked to:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;osteoporosis and hip fracture&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;heart disease and myocardial infarction&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;strokes and cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;prostate cancer (indeed, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;low levels create higher risk&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;senile dementia&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;A recent study published in 2010 in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Journal of Alzheimers Disease&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; has additionally linked low testosterone in older men to Alzheimers disease. Still, there are many mainstream medical professionals who question these results and refuse to believe in the therapeutic value of maintaining normal testosterone levels in aging men and women. Low testosterone is not considered a life-threatening problem and many physicians simply do not know how to diagnose or treat it.&amp;amp;nbsp;The problem starts when the testicles slowly begin to reduce testosterone production at around age 30. By the time a man reaches his 50s, he may be feeling miserable. This slow but eminent progression is called Andropause, the clinical term sometimes coined as male menopause. A man over the age of 40 needs to think about having his testosterone checked with a simple blood test to determine a baseline for the next decades of his life.Addressing the symptoms of low testosterone is not enough. Injections, creams, gels, patches and erectile dysfunction drugs may provide temporary relief but will do nothing to achieve the homeostatic environment, or internal equilibrium in which your internal system thrives. This can only be achieved by adjusting your bodys physiological processes using low-dose,&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Bio-Identical Hormones&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=268&amp;quot;&amp;gt; bio-identical testosterone pellets&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;, such as the method found with &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle Therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.

While there, he is speaking at two top-ranking hospitals one in Nahariya on the north coast of Israel, and the other located near Tel Aviv. In addition, Tutera is scheduled to present at numerous other events that include both professional and personal speaking engagements.Tutera, who is celebrating 40 years of medical practice, said I am very pleased to have this opportunity to share my knowledge and expertise with practitioners in Israel. Many are very invested in finding innovative, evidence-based ways to help their patients remain healthy as they age. Tutera went on to say, SottoPelle falls precisely into that category. Ive been administering this HRT method for many years now and continue to find it an excellent solution for patients suffering from hormonal imbalancemost of whom come to me struggling with disruptive symptoms and health issues. Its always remarkable to witness the positive changes and renewed vitality they have after they commit to this therapy.SottoPelle hormone replacement therapy employs bioidentical pellet implantsa delivery method thats been available and positively researched since the 1930s. Tutera, who has used this modality longer than most American colleagues in his field, combines high quality pellets with his proprietary web-based dosing application and a unique pellet insertion method in order to ensure maximum benefit for each patient.Maintaining hormonal balance is vital to preserving quality of life and well-being as you age said Tutera. Its crucial to helping your body work the way its supposed to. However, restoring key hormones to a balanced ratio is a delicate matter that not every physician knows how to achieve. He went on to say, After 40 years of personal research and observation, I can confidently say that the SottoPelle method, when properly administered, represents the most precise, effective and safe HRT method available. Its the reason Im really excited to share it with physicians and patients everywhere."

"description": "",
"content": "June is Mens Health Month. What a great reminder for men to get those annual checkups scheduled! Regular doctor visits and early screenings are, of course, essential to maintaining good health. Annual blood tests and a prostate exam should be at the top of every mans must do list for his prostate health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. The American Cancer Society estimates that 233,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2014. Of those, approximately 29,480 will die from it. In truth, most prostate cancers grow gradually and dont cause prostate health concerns in the men who have them. And the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer dont die from it. However, routine examinations can catch it in its early stages. This means more timely treatment and a greater chance of survival. One of the first things I do when new male patients come to me for testosterone replacement therapy is to talk to them about prostate health. I do require annual prostate monitoring. I believe it simply makes good health sense since cancer can already be present without symptoms prior to beginning testosterone replacement therapy. Screenings also help catch other prostate problems that may exist and are easily treatable. Its important to note that symptoms should never be ignored. They do have a cause &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;and&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; a purpose. If you experience symptoms, by all means see a doctor right away. Dont wait. Signs to pay attention to include:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Difficulty starting urination&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Weak or interrupted flow of urine&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Frequent urination, particularly at night&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Problems emptying the bladder completely&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pain or burning during urination&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Blood in the urine or semen&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Chronic back, hip, or pelvis pain&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Painful ejaculation.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;These symptoms do not necessarily indicate prostate cancer. They can be caused by other issues. One final word: There is a myth associated with testosterone replacement therapy. For decades, the medical establishment wrongly assumed that testosterone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. As a physician who has prescribed bioidentical testosterone replacement therapy for many years, Ive seen firsthand its positive effects. Healthy testosterone levels, in fact, support a healthy prostate. Medical research continues to associate these beneficially higher testosterone levels with a decreased risk of aggressive prostate disease. The real danger to a mans prostate health, as well as to his general health, is actually low testosterone. Thats why properly administered bioidentical testosterone replacement therapy remains a key component of healthy aging.&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #808080;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Blog Author: Gino Tutera MD, FACOG, has practiced as a board certified OB\/GYN for 40 years.

Experiments in mice showed that obesity increases the formation of reactive Oxygen species in fat cells, shortens telomeres- and ultimately results in activation of the p533 tumor suppressor, inflammation and the promotion of insulin resistance. (Nature Medicine 15,996-997 (2009).Hormone Restoration via PELLET DELIVERY SYSTEM is a revolutionary breakthrough in the ongoing Aging revolution in an attempt to find ways to improve the quality of life to our patients.Hormone production and metabolism can be affected by systemic illnesses, opioid therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, recreational drugs, eating disorders and excessive exercise.Pain is a stressor in the HPG axis and constant pain may drain the hormone reserve in any gland in this system and require sub-replacement as long as pain persists. Dr. Tennant October 2014 Bulletin. Long-acting Opioid Analgesics suppresses the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis and produce hormone deficiency, particularly profound in patients on Methadone Maintenance Therapy and to some extent buprenorphine.Hormone Restoration Therapy increases the intellectual function, physical activity, Quality of life, opioid effectiveness, happiness, energy, sleep, libido and stimulates appetite. Hormone therapy decreases depression, hyperalgesia, allodynia and hopelessness and the effects on pain is longer intervals between flares, decreased baseline pain, low pain days, pain free hours, fewer flares and less breakthrough pain.

"content": "Which came first the hormonal imbalance or the anxiety? Sounds a lot like the chicken and the egg question, doesnt it? While many different conditions can trigger anxiety, recent studies indicate that stress goes hand in hand with &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Andropause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.Panic attacks often strike perimenopausal women the hardest as their hormonal changes fluctuate dramatically. But other factors can contribute to the anxiety generally associated with menopause.Depression, poor concentration, muscle tension, irritability, fatigue, insomnia and sleep disorders are all anxiety-related and symptomatic of &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;. However, many women wonder if their life circumstances or their hormones are to blame.Sue, a 47-year-old working mom, has a full share of anxiety between her job as an office manager and her duties at home. She often experiences extreme fatigue and finds it difficult to concentrate on her work. Despite her exhaustion, she has trouble falling asleep. She wakes throughout the night, wrought with tension, restlessness, nervous sweats and an inability to go back to sleep.Sue wonders if its her anxiety from the job keeping her up at night or her hormones making her toss and turn. Maybe its the stress of college tuition costs for her three kids.How can women know the difference between everyday anxiety and the menopausal kind? More importantly, what can they do to alleviate anxiety altogether?Sue initially made some lifestyle changes reducing her coffee intake, replacing sugars and junk food with healthier meals, taking a yoga class and walking more. She also started doing more relaxing things before bedtime, such as taking a hot scented bath instead of watching the news.Still, the night sweats continued. Thats when she decided to have her hormone levels tested and try &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle Therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.Sues lab tests showed that she was pre-menopausal and really low in &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Estrogen&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1446&amp;quot;&amp;gt;estrogen&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;, an imbalance that leads to stress in the body, thyroid disorder and adrenal fatigue. She started sleeping better after taking &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Bio-Identical Hormones&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=268&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bio-identical progesterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; before bedtime and found that it alleviated her anxiety and calmed her nerves.&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;What is Hormone Replacement Therapy?&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=260&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; helped Sue get through menopause naturally and safely, without the hot flashes, nervous jitters and tension that formerly kept her up all night and reaching for the caffeine all day.Anxiety can also result when &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; levels drop as men enter &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Andropause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;. Balancing these hormones with pellet therapy effectively relieves the anxiety and irritability that often plagues men at this time.To determine if your symptoms are due to the hormonal imbalances of &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Andropause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1442&amp;quot;&amp;gt;andropause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; or a deeper emotional cause, and more information about SottoPelle Therapy, lab tests and hormone evaluations, visit &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;FAQs&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=215&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/faqs&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;\/.

Like many NFL players Ive had some dark and difficult times due to my CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy a degenerative brain disease caused by repetitive brain trauma). I started not to have fun and didnt want to do anything; my memory was going and I just didnt care what would happen to me. At one time I didnt care if I left or not. I went to other clinics and doctors and they told me they really couldnt tell what my problem is. I tried these tiny pellets and started feeling better. I could concentrate, read, relax, and Im good again. Its changed my life! SottoPelle is the answer for me.The SottoPelle method for hormone replacement was scientifically created by Gino Tutera, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., who is an internationally renowned leader in the field of bio-identical (natural) hormone replacement.I chose SottoPelle to help me achieve balance in my body and mind, which I have been struggling with for a long time, said DeLamielleure. I have never put anything in my body that was not natural and I have never used alcohol, drugs, or steroids; I have always been a health nut. I am recommending this to my fellow players, friends and even my family I wouldnt do that unless I believed it was completely safe and the best form of hormone replacement available.These men go, go, go. On a monthly basis, they travel an average 25 days coast to coast doing speaking engagements, appearances, etc. They have to be engaging and interactive at every stop -- every airport, hotel, restaurant, says Megan Holland, director of the HOF Players Classic. Traumatic Brain Injury is all over the news, but what the world doesnt see is the stress, pain and anguish it causes these legends and their families. They cant sleep, become frustrated because they cant concentrate and staying on track becomes extremely difficult, in addition to lifes daily struggles. Then combine them all together and you have combustion, depression and mood swings. Over the past nine months, I have watched SottoPelle give these men back their desire to live, to take care of their families and fellow players in need. They are sleeping, able to concentrate, happy and excited for what the future holds.HOF Players Classic is proud to call SottoPelle a partner and forever will be indebted to Dr. Tutera for giving these players and all their NFL teammates the opportunity to function and enjoy life again.SottoPelle uses tiny hormone pellets custom-compounded using natural, plant-derived hormones that are biologically identical to the testosterone and estrogen made by the human body. Numerous studies have shown that when prescribed and administered correctly, bio-identical hormone pellets can benefit a variety of conditionsincluding symptoms of menopause, andropause (male menopause), depression, weight gain and osteoporosis.We are thrilled to have Paul, Joe D. and Bobby share their inspirational stories, said Carol Tutera, president of SottoPelle, Inc. SottoPelle has changed countless lives for the better and, with these legends of the NFL as a part of the SottoPelle TEAM, we know we can continue to help so many other people, save more lives and help millions more people live a better, more balanced, happier life at any age.For more information about SottoPelle, bio-identical hormones and natural hormone replacement therapy, visit http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com.&amp;amp;nbsp;Related LinksSottoPelle TherapyVideo -&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;%20http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u_bYYSVnhE8&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;quot;&amp;gt; http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u_bYYSVnhE8&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;Photo - &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnh\/20140630\/123156&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnh\/20140630\/123156&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;Logo - &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnh\/20140630\/123156&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnh\/20140630\/123155&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;"

Do simple tasks leave you feeling flat lined?I hear this from my patients all the time and fatigue seems to be affecting everyone in some way these days. Pick up any national magazine and chances are youll find a headline boasting of some quick fix to Fight Fatigue Now!While such debilitating fatigue can be due to dozens of causes, most doctors simply chalk it up to modern-day stress and tell patients to slow down and get more rest. Such good advice often fails to address the real root of the problem and offers no viable support to help men and women combat their fatigue.Hormones play a major role how you feel throughout the day and fatigue often results when there is a hormonal balance. Think of your hormones like the remote control for your TV, enabling you to switch channels and adjust volume, brightness, picture quality and other important functions. &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Estrogen&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1446&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Estrogen&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; act as biochemical messengers, communicating with each other to fine-tune your physiology and energy similar to the way your remote control changes the settings on your TV.Fatigue hits women particularly hard, especially during&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt; menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and perimenopause due to rapid decline of the female hormones.

A sudden sensation of overwhelming warmth and uncomfortable heat sweeps across the head and upper body, often accompanied by embarrassing redness and flushing in the face, neck and chest. Other symptoms include a rapid heart rate, profuse nighttime sweating, palpitations and even chills.Here come the dreaded hot flashes!According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, approximately 75 percent of women struggle with this personal global warming when they enter their menopausal years and brace for the change.

We hear a lot of humor about hot flashes, often referred to as power surges, but any woman who is experiencing them will report that they are no laughing matter.Sleepless nights, an inability to focus, intense waves of debilitating tingling plus rashes and irritability disrupt womens everyday lives. While most resources tell women to avoid caffeine and get more rest, the insomnia triggered by hot flashes keeps them reaching for the coffee and colas to get through the day that, in turn, contribute to the hot flushes keeping them awake all night in a vicious circle.What can you do right now to find quick relief?Some immediate ways to minimize hot flashes include:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;stress reduction and relaxation techniques&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;keeping the bedroom cooler at night&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine and other stimulants will also help to alleviate the symptoms&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;maintaining a healthy lifestyle with good diet and exercise&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;While these can certainly help to provide some relief, natural &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hormone replacement therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; using bio-identical estrogen and progesterone can eliminate hot flashes altogether.&amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle bio-identical hormone pellets&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; work with your bodys natural rhythms quickly, safely and effectively.

"content": "Youve tried everything to lose weight.From crash diets and pretzel-shaped yoga poses to all those tabloid tricks and even starvation. Your medicine cabinet is crammed with bottles of coffee bean extract and the latest Dr. Oz quick fix. Yet the stubborn pounds remain glued to your hips.Every day new patients come into my office wailing about their weight. They eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly and still cant shed the pounds. Whats wrong with this picture?Can you blame your hormones for those love handles? And can &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Hormone Replacement Therapy&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hormone replacement therapy&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; help you lose weight.In most cases, the answer is yes! Hormones control your metabolism and where you store your fat, and numerous studies prove the connection between hormones and weight loss. Extra weight on the hips, belly and thighs is often a sign of hormonal imbalance, such as a testosterone deficiency or a drop in female hormones like estrogen. And that can cause the scale to tip in the wrong direction.While other factors such as low thyroid, insulin resistance, high blood sugar and cortisol levels, insufficient sleep and leptin resistance all affect weight loss, they are often related to hormonal imbalance itself and therefore keep many people trapped in a vicious circle.Let me explain this further.The body cant maintain its normal systemic functions without proper hormonal balance. Simply relying on a crash diet when your hormones are out of balance means that your system cannot derive much benefit.You can take all the best supplements and do all the exercises in the world and you still wont lose weight. Its like pouring high quality oil on a cracked engine; the car still isnt going to run.There needs to be more emphasis on the physiologic restoration that hormones provide rather than just the relief of menopausal symptoms since weight loss is a multifaceted issue and slow process. Maintaining a normal physiologic state by balancing the hormones will help to maximize your weight loss efforts.Dont give up! With proper lifestyle changes, monitoring of your hormone levels and the use of precise doses of bio-identical hormones custom-compounded to suit your bodys specific needs, you can start to see the scale swing back to normal.Here are 5 effective steps you can take right now to promote weight loss:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stick to a low-fat, low-carb diet with as much fresh food and produce as possible.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Avoid refined sugars and starches and processed food&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Bump up your low-fat protein intake. Turkey, eggs, beans and shellfish are good choices.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Find some time each day to exercise. Just 30 minutes a day in 10-minute spurts of high-intensit intervals will do wonders for your waistline and speed up the weight loss.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Get a full nights sleep. Studies show that proper rest is critical to maintain a healthy weight since the body produces metabolic hormones during sleep. Anything less than 7.5 hours per night can disrupt the hormones that affect your appetite and fat-burning capacity.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Next well talk about &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Testosterone&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1451&amp;quot;&amp;gt;testosterone&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; and the pivotal role it plays in weight loss. While it helps convert fat into lean muscle, keep in mind that hormones alone are not the magic bullet to shed those pounds. Instead, I recommend a balanced lifestyle approach while balancing your hormones with the &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Our Method&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=42&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SottoPelle&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; natural approach to safe, effective hormone replacement therapy using bio-identical pellets.Visit our SottoPelle &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Facebook page&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; and check out the link we posted this week for the latest report on how low testosterone levels can add to your &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;Menopause&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;\/?page_id=1444&amp;quot;&amp;gt;menopause&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; misery.

"content": "OK, guys, its your turn. Has low testosterone got you down? Maybe youre embarrassed to admit that youve lost your vim and vigor.If you feel more like a Wimpy than a Popeye these days or even the Wizard of Oz Straw Man instead of Superman, it might be time to check your hormone levels.After all the fuss about menopause, the spotlight has turned to man-opause a phrase coined to describe andropause, which is caused by testosterone deficiency or Low T. While the hormonal imbalances men undergo after age 40 often mimic those of women in menopause -- such as low energy and even hot flashes it is rarely talked about among men or mentioned by their doctors.Instead, they are expected to tough it out instead of expressing feminine complaints like moodiness, depression, muscle weakness, fatigue, low sex drive, confusion and so on.Andropause is no longer a myth but a very real fact of life as men age and gradually experience low testosterone and other hormonal imbalances. As a result, men silently live with their debilitating fatigue, irritability, weight gain, insomnia, low libido and many other telltale signs of low testosterone levels with nowhere to turn but to drugs such as Viagra and Cialis, chalking it all up to mid-life crisis.By the age of 50, most men have significantly low testosterone levels. Research indicates that more than half of men in their sixties suffer silently from andropause or some form of testosterone deficiency. By their seventies, 90 percent of men show signs of Low T.According to a study released by the Sexual Medicine Society of North America in November 2009, increasing numbers of men over 40 report the following andropause symptoms:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;reduced libido, muscle mass, strength, endurance and bone density&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;incidents of erectile dysfunction and depression&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;increased fatigue, moodiness, irritability and insomnia&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;decreased energy, motivation, mental clarity and cognition&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Despite all the TV ads promoting hormone replacement supplements for men to boost their testosterone levels, few doctors diagnose andropause or thus fail to treat the symptoms properly. Instead, men receive the usual lifestyle advice: eat right, exercise more and get more rest. But many just cant muster the energy to get on the treadmill, and hormonal imbalances go hand in hand with insomnia.Men need to be aware that generic hormone replacement supplements and synthetic testosterone injections do not provide the right kind of safe hormones in the specific individual doses required for effective treatment of Low T symptoms. Pills, patches, gels and creams in one-size-fits-all doses can cause roller coaster hormone surges and the only guarantee is to empty your wallet.Still, you dont have to live with andropause or man up and bear it. Millions of men are finding help for their hormonal imbalances with bio-identical testosterone in the form of hormone replacement pellet therapy.SottoPelle natural hormone replacement therapy with bio-identical testosterone pellets offers a natural, safe and effective approach to help restore hormonal balance and get you back on the treadmill and fast track to good health.

Check out the news reports on this that we have posted below for your convenience.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The advisory panel posed concerns that over 25 percent of the men currently taking these products have been administered testosterone without proper lab work to warrant any treatment. These men also lack individual dosing or post-treatment follow-up to monitor their symptoms and health, often resulting in heart attacks.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;As a result, the FDA has imposed new regulations to manage the use of these generic synthetic testosterone drugs. The FDA advisory came exactly one month to the day after Time magazine featured its &amp;quot;Mano-pause&amp;quot; cover story about the booming synthetic Low T business.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Another report on Fierce Biotech, a daily online monitor for the drug industry, explains the story behind the facts, with last-ditch scrambles by drug manufacturers to salvage their Low T wares in the face of new FDA regulations.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;According to Dr. Gino Tutera -- founder of SottoPelle Therapy, a system of individually tailored bio-identical hormone pellets -- good medicine is about safeguarding human health instead of imposing such serious health risks to millions of people.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Everyone doesnt wear the same shoes size,&amp;quot; Dr. Tutera explains. &amp;quot;Back in the early 90s, I realized that there is no one-size-fits-all hormone for everyone. Each patient is uniquely different and must be treated as an individual.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The science of pellet hormone therapy is based on precise doses of bio-identical hormones instead of synthetic ones. But what exactly does this mean and how do pellets work?&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;A bio-identical hormone is one whose molecular structure contains the exact biochemical structure as the human hormone itself. And think of the pellet, about the size of a grain of rice, inserted under the skin as a reservoir that sits in your body awaiting the signal to release the necessary amount of hormone.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The pellets release of hormone is controlled by the heart rate. Therefore, as long as the patients heart is beating, the secretion of hormone is continuous and will vary according to the patients needs. The body therefore controls the release of continuous hormone, naturally increasing or decreasing the amount of hormone released according to the bodys needs.&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Pretty incredible, isnt it?&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;In addition to right kind of natural hormone, safe and effective hormone therapy requires the following criteria:&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Proper testing with thorough analysis and diagnosis&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Customized doses based on each individuals patients needs&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The hormone needs to be replaced in the exact ratio in which the body produces it to create the maximum physiologic protection&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The delivery system must replicates the secretion pattern of the organ being replicated, i.e., the ovary or testicle&amp;lt;\/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot; \/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: #666666;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Pellet hormone replacement is one of the most researched forms of hormone delivery, starting in the 1930s in Austria and continued after that by Dr. R Greenblatt from the University of Georgia Medical College.

I am an active gynecologic surgeon devoting a significant portion of my practice to the care of women with pelvic floor disorders and urinary incontinence. I am also an advocate for minimally invasive procedures, and am dedicated to offering the best and most advanced options available to my patients.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;For many years I have struggled to balance the controversies regarding hormonal therapy with the significant and life disrupting symptoms suffered by women with hormonal imbalance. Severe hot flashes decreased sex drive, lack of energy and just feeling out of place are not symptoms conducive to a happy and healthy life. Many other areas of life are negatively impacted by this. Furthermore the underlying health concerns from hormonal imbalance are just as significant. Finally I have found a therapy option that I feel to be safe and extremely effective to help women suffering from hormonal issues.SottoPelle Therapy is an all-natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy that specializes in the use of subcutaneous testosterone and estradiol pellets. This method was first used in 1937 in England and Australia. The use of biologically identical, non-synthetic, testosterone and estradiol is safe, and the use of pellets as the delivery method provides is effective. The delivery method of pellets allows for the continual release of the hormone the key to improving brain and muscle function. Other delivery methods result in sporadic, or a roller coaster, effect in the delivery and release of hormones within the body. These methods include pills, patches, injectables, and creams. Literature shows that the use of pellets and all natural testosterone carries less risk compared to synthetic testosterone. We use a science based approach to prescribing (dosing) the patient the appropriate amount of testosterone and\/or estradiol based on specific factors about the individual and their blood analysis. This results in achieving physiologic hormonal balance-something research has shown is absolutely vital to good health and well-being. Of all hormonal replacement modalities, only pellet therapy can provide this balance 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.At Minnesota Womens Care we believe in providing the best care based on each womans unique needs. We believe in finding solutions for conditions that diminish the quality of your life - solutions that are consistent with each womans needs and her desired approach to treatment. Sotto Pelle Therapy for women symptomatic from hormone deficiency is one such therapy. Why live with constant hot flashes, emotional ups and downs, decreased sex drive, deteriorating bone conditions and all the negative consequences of hormone deficiencies. Stop Coping, Start Living!&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;"

"content": "The statistics certainly appear intimidating, but dont let breast cancer scare you this Halloween month! A diagnosis is not a death sentence, and October is designated as Breast Cancer Awareness Month to help women become pro-active in better prevention and detection of the disease.Lets look at some data and then at some steps you can take to fight back.Breast cancer by the numbers:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;One in eight women will be diagnosed with the disease&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A woman is diagnosed with breast cancer every 3 minutes&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;One woman dies every 13 minutes from breast cancer&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;More than 250,000 women with the disease are under 40&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Men can get breast cancer and 1 in every 1,000 men are diagnosed each year&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;There are approximately 3 million breast cancer survivors in the U.S.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;For Dr. Gino Tutera, these statistics posed an incentive to research the role of bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) in breast cancer prevention. Dr. Tutera developed a customized form of BHRT in pellet form delivering the precise dosage of hormones that each individual needs to restore the bodys natural physiological balance.In his research, he discovered the role of bio-identical testosterone pellet therapy in helping to prevent breast cancer. While still widely regarded as a predominantly male hormone, testosterone is essential for women to maintain their normal physiology. Yet this scientific fact remains largely ignored.Around age forty, there is an increase in fibrocystic disease of the breast, Dr. Tutera explains. It coincides with women losing 50 percent of their testosterone production. Testosterone therapy helps decrease over-activity of cells in the breast and if you decrease cell proliferation, you cut down on the occurrence of cystic disease.According to Dr. Tuteras 10-year breast cancer study*, the restoration of normal testosterone levels for women at risk for or suffering from breast cancer can make a significant difference in prevention of the disease. Maintaining proper levels of testosterone offers a lifesaving alternative for breast cancer patients who see not only a higher level of survivability, but also a lower chance of recurrence.Breast cancer patients are uniformly subjected to the usual treatment of no hormones whatsoever, which actually shortens the life span, says Dr. Tutera. Through testosterone replacement with SottoPelle, we have the capability to help patients get their quality of life back.In addition to maintaining your hormonal balance and obtaining regular mammograms, here are some simple lifestyle approaches that can help you ward off the disease:&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stay active&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; and keep your body moving! Thats right just 10 hours of exercise each week can lower your risk by 30 percent.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Eat a healthy diet&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; of whole foods with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Drink less alcohol&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; and fill up on more water. According to several recent studies, limiting alcohol consumption reduces a womans risk of developing the disease.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conduct monthly breast self-examinations. &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;This represents one of the simplest and easiest preventative steps you can take.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Maintain a healthy weight &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;New research suggests that larger skirt sizes go hand in hand with greater risks for developing breast cancer.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;Approximately 3 million breast cancer survivors are living proof that this disease can be beaten. More than 98 percent of cases survive due to early detection.

"content": "OK, ladies, were halfway through Pinktober, with another two weeks left to go of all the rosy reminders to line up for the monster mammogram machine!While breast cancer is certainly more of a tragedy than a comedy, some studies* suggest that good humor and belly laughter may not only save the day but maybe your life too.According to Nobel Prize-winning medical researcher Dr. Otto Warburg, a strong relationship exists between the lack of oxygen in our cells and the development of cancer. His studies show that hearty laughter stimulates the release of endorphins in the brain, which oxygenates the body and deters cancer cell growth.Author Pam Lacko knows that all too well without knowing any science. After surviving a hysterectomy and bout of ovarian cancer, the working mom learned that breast cancer was next on her list of woes. Instead of crying and screaming, Pam decided that laughter would be a lot more fun and healing.Finding comedy in the face of cancer proved to be a powerful recovery elixir for Pam as she bravely grinned her way through a mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. I would rather have people joke with me than feel sorry for me, she says.That included medical staff with whom she developed buoyant relationships. On her final day of treatment, the nurses gathered round to sing Pam a victory song and posed with her for pictures.Pam eventually turned her blog into a book called &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Laughing in the Face of Cancer, &amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;which remains enormously popular with cancer patients of all kinds. She writes: Medication and treatment heal the body, but humor heals the mind.We totally agree. So weve taken a tip from Pam and collected a few cartoons and chuckles to keep your spirits up through those pancake-flattening mammograms this month.Halloween is just around the corner, so don your witchs hat to put a curse on breast cancer or just let out a wicked witchs cackle to humor those tumors away!SOURCES&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.healingcancernaturally.com\/laughter-is-medicine.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.healingcancernaturally.com\/laughter-is-medicine.html&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;* &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.laughteryogaamerica.com\/learn\/research\/350-scientific-research-papers-laughter-669.php&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.laughteryogaamerica.com\/learn\/research\/350-scientific-research-papers-laughter-669.php&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Author: &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Gino Tutera, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., is a board-certified OB\/GYN who has practiced medicine combining good science and common sense for 40 years.

"content": "&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The real truth about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Are you spooked by recent reports citing the supposed dangers of hormone therapy? Dont be tricked by all the confusing or conflicting articles that will not only scare the dickens out of you, but also fail to distinguish between the two very different types of hormones the safe kind and the harmful variety. In fact, weve got a treat in store for you with some good news about why the right dose of beneficial hormones can actually help women, and not harm them.The array of alarming hormone reports online and in print are often scary and widely accepted as the gospel truth, but many of the things written are out of context or not based on all the facts.Like scenes from a cult horror flick, these reports continue like bad sequels featuring the same familiar demons from years ago. The Womens Health Initiative (WHI) issued its first report on the dangers of synthetic hormone therapy a long time ago. Now this ghost haunts us once again as the outdated scare script rears its ugly head this month with yet another claim about the health hazards of hormone therapy.What these reports fail to ever mention is that there are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT types of hormone therapies the natural bio-identical kind (BHRT) and the synthetic pharmaceutical type (HRT) symptoms.Think of it like the two witches in the Wizard of Oz the wicked one being the hazardous hormones and then theres the good witch, the bio-identical benefactor. With the wave of a wand, one can threaten your well-being while the other can bestow health blessings.Seems simple enough, but why dont more people understand or explain this basic difference?Due to the lack in patient education on the hormone facts, were stepping up this Halloween to set the record straight and put these ghosts to rest. Well also give you a goodie for your hormone trick or treat bag because we believe women dont need to be scared just informed.Keep in mind that most articles and blogs are usually focused on the synthetic hormones (HRT) the bad witch and will try to spook you -- but weve got your back. The fact is that bio-identical hormones (BHRT) the good witch is perfectly safe without any of the harmful side effects associated with the synthetic hormones in the WHI report.So, yes, the WHI is right in that synthetic hormones are harmful for you. They just forgot to mention the potential benefits of the natural bio-identical ones that are backed by scientific studies showing their safety and effectiveness.Consequently, a well-researched report in &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The New York Times&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;, Avoiding Estrogen Therapy Proved Deadly for Nearly 50,000 Women, echoes Dr. Tuteras longtime concerns. The article notes that according to a report in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;American Journal of Public Health&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, the widespread rejection of allhormone replacement therapies among menopausal women has been misguided since the WHI warnings against HRT were issued in 2002.In other words, since all forms of hormone therapy were improperly condemned as harmful due to the earlier WHI findings, an estimated 50,000 women died prematurely from 2002-2009 because they did not use estrogen after hysterectomies. Could BHRT have saved some lives? We also wonder how many uncounted women suffered from heart attacks, dementia, and other ailments associated with lack of estrogen.While thats a scary statistic, SottoPelle has some reassuring information for you.BHRTs potential benefits are now documented in Dr. Tuteras 10-year study titled Marked reduction of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer in users of bio-identical estradiol and testosterone subcutaneous pellets. The results have been published in two prestigious medical publications &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;SEMAL&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;, an international anti-aging medical journal , and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Maturitas&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;, a U.S. peer-reviewed scientific journal in 2009. This research shows that his pellet method of estradiol and testosterone therapy offers protection against the development of several forms of cancer.We think thats not only exciting news, but worthy of worldwide headlines.In his study, Dr. Tutera concludes:&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Womens Health Initiative incorrectly implied that all estrogen increases the development of breast cancer after three years. This inaccurate assumption prompted women to discontinue all forms of hormone therapy and suffer the ravages of menopause and possibly increase their risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, dementia and many other diseases. &amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The present retrospective study was done to prove that the usage of bio-identical estradiol, testosterone and micronized progesterone did not increase the incidence of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer. The study affirmed that the re-creation of the normal physiologic hormonal environment through the usage of subcutaneous estradiol and testosterone pellets imparts a protective effect against the development of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Furthermore, the usage of subcutaneous estradiol and testosterone pellets should be encouraged because of the positive effects seen on bone density , the lack of adverse impact on serum lipids, the lack of adverse effect on cardiovascular health and superior control of the symptoms associated with the menopause.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;Adding more goblins to the hormone scare is another report issued this month by The Endocrine Society with its clinical guidelines for androgen therapy in women, claiming that there is insufficient research or evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of testosterone therapy. Huh? More hormone horrors? Tell that to the thousands of female SottoPelle patients thriving on testosterone around the globe.In response, Dr. Tutera provides the following facts backed by their accompanying studies:&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Once again we are being misled; the lack of knowledge about the young females need for testosterone is a physiologic fact. The daily production of testosterone by premenopausal women from ovarian and adrenal sources is 300 mg daily, not weekly or annually (Abraham et al J Clin Endo Metab.1974:39:340-346). The assays that we are all using do not reflect this value. In fact &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;all of the assays have been shown to be inaccurate, unreliable, and insensitive &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;and only have value in assessing the male patient as they lose their accuracy below a level of 300 ng\/dL. (Lobo et al Fert Sterility, 2004 :44,&amp;amp;amp; Clinical Chemistry 2005). J W W Studd stated in his work published in Meno Intl., 2010, that premenopausal women carry testosterone levels ten times the level of estrogen. Furthermore, the majority of testosterone loss occurs in the early reproductive years (Davison et al J Clin Endo Metab 2005:90:3847-3853), and that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;by age 40 normal premenopausal women have lost at least half of their testosterone production&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt; (Zumoff et al J Clin Endo Metab1995: 80:1429-1430).&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Why then are we being told that the use of testosterone is only for hypoactive sexual disorder when in fact &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;denying young women this important hormone increases the risk of bone loss, muscle loss, loss of function in the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes of the brain, and finally loss of normal metabolic rate necessary for normal physiologic function&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;? How many of us have young women in their 30s and beyond that complain of brain fog, loss of muscle, increasing fat deposition, and sexual libido loss and yet their lab levels reflect normality? We must realize that what we have considered and been told is normal is truly not normal and that the range of normal testosterone needs to be adjusted to reflect the true normal production of testosterone for women which is more accurately reflected as above 70 ng\/dL. This better reflects the true production of a normal young woman of 300mg daily.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;Perhaps it should be noted that researchers in these recent studies have admitted that some of the funding for this study was provided by drug companies. Hmmm toss that in the trick or treat bag.Dont let these misleading Testosterone Terrorizers or the Big Pharma Boogeyman scare you!

"content": "&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stress, Menopause, and Hormones Finding the Healthy Balance&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Youre so exhausted you cant keep your eyes open but yet you find yourself staying awake all night and cant get to sleep. Your mood swings up one day and drops the next. You feel like a furnace one minute and then freezing cold.Sound familiar?Getting through that stressful phase in our forties and fifties is hard enough. Men and women often face sudden changes in their work and family lives. Then along comes The Change for women, adding another layer to the multiple stressors.While stress shows up in our daily lives in many forms, some women entering menopause find themselves caught in a vicious cycle of stress and hormonal imbalance. One study in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Journal of The North American Menopause Society*&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; cites a correlation between menopause and anxiety. Stress can impact your health and overall quality of life as fluctuating levels of hormones play havoc with your mind and body. Progesterone, estrogen and testosterone imbalances can cause disrupted sleep, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, brain fog and fatigue.Dragging through the day with insufficient sleep and reaching for the caffeine will only send stress levels sky high. What can you do to get off the hormonal roller coaster ? Dont give up! Youre not going crazy even though it often feels that way. In addition to having a doctor check your hormone levels, here are some suggestions to help you manage the stresses of menopause:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/relax3.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; Take Time to Relax&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Set aside some quiet time each day for stillness and relaxation.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reduce your intake of caffeinated beverages, especially before bedtime.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Indulge in a massage, manicure or luxurious personal treatment.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Soak in a hot bath with scented candles and essential oils.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Surround yourself with good company, do something you love and dont forget to laugh!&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;November 5 is National Stress Awareness Day -- be good to yourself and visit us on &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;SottoPelle Facebook Page&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hormonereplacement&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Facebook&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; to share your tips for handling stress!&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;SOURCES*&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Abstract\/2005\/12030\/The_role_of_anxiety_and_hormonal_changes_in.6.aspx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Abstract\/2005\/12030\/The_role_of_anxiety_and_hormonal_changes_in.6.aspx&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;"

Are you experiencing hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood swings, memory problems, or loss of libido, among other symptoms?&amp;lt;\/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/section&amp;gt;Many women recognize thathot flashes may be the first obvious symptom of their bodies beginning to experience perimenopause and menopause. Though hot flashes are indeed a common complaint, they are not the only symptom that women may present to their physician. You dont have to miss a period for 12 months to have symptoms associated with these changes.Natural or bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) can help alleviate these symptoms, restoring a natural hormonal balance within the body. This type of therapy can yield exceptional results and health benefits, significantly improving your quality of life and well-being.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is Perimenopause and Menopause?&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Peri is from Greek, and means near or about Perimenopause describes the time when a womans body transitions from her fertile, child-bearing years into middle age. The body undergoes biological changes resulting from declining ovarian hormone production. Peri-menopausal symptoms sometimes begin in your late 30s and early 40s. It is the beginning phase of the change and can last up to ten years.Menopause means the end of monthly cycles a woman is considered to have reached menopause when a full year has passed since her last menstrual cycle. It is a natural, gradual process typically occuring in women around the age of 50, when a womans ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone, and her lifetime supply of eggs becomes depleted.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Symptoms of Perimenopause and Menopause&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Women going through Perimenopause and menopause often experience a combination of some or all of the following symptoms: irregular menstrual periods, hot flashes, night sweats and\/or cold flashes, clammy skin, irritability, insomnia, mood swings, sudden tears, depression, loss of libido, vaginal dryness, heart palipitations, urinary urgency, inability to sleep through the night, depression and weight gain, especially belly fat. All leading to an overall lower quality of life.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are Bio-Identical Hormones? &amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Hormones are chemical messengers that transport information between cells and facilitate communication among different body organs, regulating various functions of our body. The first hormone replacement supplements were developed in the 1930s to provide relief from symptoms of menopause. These first hormone supplements were bio-identical in that they had a chemical structure and biological action identical to natural hormones produced by the human body.Bio-identical hormones are derived from plants, primarily soy and yam, and undergo transformation in the chemical laboratory to create the end products, hormones. Because bio-identical hormones are identical to human hormones, our bodies can utilize and metabolize them easily, without the unpleasant and dangerous side effects that synthetic or horse hormones can have. Bio-identical hormones are prescribed by a medical doctor and are specfiically custom-made for you by a compounding pharmacist, according to a doctors prescription.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What are Synthetic Hormones?&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Synthetic hormone supplements were first developed in the 1940s. Synthetic hormones are derived from plant and animal progestins, and estrogens, and are usually not chemically identical to the hormones your body uses. These mass-produced synthetic hormones do NOT match the molecular structure of the naturally occurring hormones in our bodies.Current, traditional hormone replacement therapy utilizes synthetic products to alleviate the symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats without restoring the normal hormonal balance one needs to feel good. While reducing the menopausal symptoms, synthetic hormones may generate many unpleasant side effects including water retention, breast engorgement, and weight gain. Synthetic estrogens, especially when combined with synthetic progestins, may also increase health risks including breast cancer, heart attacks, stroke and blood clots. Beacause of these side effects, many women stop their hormone replacement therapy on their own and suffer the remainder of their life.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Restoring Natural Hormonal Balance&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Bio-identical hormones, with their biological action and metabolic pathways identical to human hormones, not only ease the unpleasant symptoms of perimenopause, menopause and andropause (male menopause), more importantly, they restore youthful hormonal balance as well as provide the body with the same protective health benefits the bodys own natural hormones would provide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About Dr. Mirabile&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Sotto Bio:&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/doctors\/james-mirabile-md-facog\/&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;"

In years past, the symptoms of low testosterone were attributed to normal changes associated with aging, often called a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;mid-life crisis&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;. Doctors typically instructed patients to accept their plight because they werent spring chickens anymore. So things like hair loss, paunchiness, or erectile dysfunction were either not discussed or symptomatically treated with anti-depressants or male enhancement drugs.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Andropause, the male version of Menopause&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Every man experiences a gradual decline in hormone production as he gets older. Beginning at age 30, his body starts to manufacture less and less testosterone, losing roughly one to 3 percent per year. Then, sometime between age 40 and 55, testosterone levels drop dramatically and signal the onset of Andropause, the medical term for the male equivalent of Menopause. Throughout this process, men find themselves putting on weight, losing muscle mass, feeling sluggish, feeling depressed and becoming increasingly irritable. They remember a time when they had energy for work and family, but those days are now few and far between. They find it harder to concentrate at work and their workouts are cut short by pain or fatigue that didnt previously exist. The realization is even more troubling for those men who begin to experience lack of sexual drive and impotence.

Your hormones could be to blame!Hormones are important to all body functions and play a significant role in your ability to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. There are many hormonal imbalances that can occur in the body including, but not limited to: elevated insulin, elevated cortisol, elevated or low estrogen, low testosterone, low DHEA, and hypothyroidism. It is important to recognize possible imbalances that may be occurring in the body and correct them in order to reach your weight loss goals.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Insulin the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;fat storage&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt; hormone&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Insulin has an important job. It processes the sugar in the blood stream and carries it to your cells its then used for energy or stored for later use in the form of fat. Elevated levels of insulin can be caused by excess consumption of carbohydrates. A diet high in carbohydrates, such as processed foods and sugary beverages, in combination with a low protein and low fiber intake, can lead to the storage of fat, weight gain and high insulin levels. Poor diet along with lack of exercise, alcohol consumption, stress and high blood pressure can lead to chronically high levels of insulin and the development of Type 2 diabetes.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Cortisol the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;stress &amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;hormone&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;High levels of cortisol can be harmful to your health. Studies indicate that a high stress level can contribute to the accumulation of belly fat. Cortisol levels are higher in people who suffer from conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and excessive fatigue. Not only does elevated cortisol lead to belly fat, it also increases appetite and cravings. This is why people turn to comfort foods when feeling significant amounts of stress! Other harmful effects of high cortisol include decreased bone density, memory loss and depression. What is the best way to combat high cortisol? Get some sleep! At least 7 hours a night. It is also important to eat a high protein breakfast and find an outlet for all that stress. Activities such as yoga, meditation or even taking a long walk can help decrease stress.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Estrogen the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;reproductive&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt; hormone&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Both men and women naturally produce estrogen. In men, an excess of belly fat can cause testosterone to be converted to estrogen. As a mans estrogen level rises, so does the fat accumulation. In addition, high levels of estrogen in men can contribute to prostate cancer and heart disease. In women, both excess estrogen and low estrogen contribute to weight gain and difficulty maintaining a healthy weight. Estrogen levels fluctuate as a woman goes through phases of her reproductive life. What can be done if you suspect an estrogen imbalance? Get your hormones tested. Testing can identify if an estrogen imbalance exists and what methods of treatment would be best. Also it is important to eat a healthy diet including green tea, flax seed and chia seeds. All of these products can assist the body in processing extra estrogen in the body.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Testosterone the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;sex &amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt;hormone&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Increased stress (high cortisol levels), abdominal fat and aging all contribute to low testosterone levels. Low levels of testosterone can lead to conditions such as depression, obesity, heart disease, loss of muscle tone, decreased stamina and decreased libido. Simple hormone testing can identify a low level of testosterone. When levels are corrected, it has been shown to decrease body fat and improve stamina, muscle mass and libido. A healthy diet in lean protein, as well as weight-bearing exercise can help naturally increase testosterone levels.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;DHEA the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;mother of all&amp;lt;\/i&amp;gt; hormones&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;There is much talk these days about DHEA, but what exactly is it? DHEA is a precursor hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that can be converted into testosterone or estrogen in the body. DHEA levels typically hit their peak in our 20s and then naturally decline as we age. DHEA is responsible for many important functions including the bodys ability to burn fat and keep it off. Low DHEA levels can be detected in hormone testing. Correcting an imbalance can improve libido, energy and weight loss.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Your thyroid gland&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;The thyroid gland is responsible for producing hormones that regulate the bodys metabolic rate, heart and digestive function, muscle control, brain development and bone maintenance. The thyroid gland can become overactive (hyperthoyrodism) or underactive (hypothyroidism). Thyroid conditions can be quite dangerous and cause many unpleasant symptoms. For patients suffering from hypothyroidism, weight gain is a common side effect. Thyroid conditions can be safely treated with medication.&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Get your levels checked&amp;lt;\/b&amp;gt;Hormones play a significant role in your health, including weight loss and weight management. A simple blood test is the first step in understanding your hormonal health. At Mirabile M.D. Beauty, Health &amp;amp;amp; Wellness, we are experts in the field of bio-identical hormone replacement therapy. We offer safe, natural and effective methods for both men and women.

"content": "Good bones rely on healthy habits, but new studies suggest that some of our long-held beliefs on the causes and treatments for osteoporosis might just be well, a bag of bones.As we age and our hormone levels shift dramatically, maintaining normal bone density becomes critical to good health. Fluctuating levels of estrogen and testosterone decrease bone strength and increase the chance of fractures. Women who undergo premature surgical menopause also remain at greater risk of developing osteoporosis, making it critical to check their hormone levels.&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/osteoporosis.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;While many menopausal women are prescribed drugs for osteoporosis, common side effects can include, surprisingly, bone loss and fractures plus blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.Before you reach for the milk container, consider a report published in Forbes* last week claiming that cows dairy causes more fractures than prevent them. While some experts will certainly find a bone to pick with that one, what can you do to maintain healthy bones without any side effects?&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Keep moving: walking and weight-resistance training offer ideal bone-fortifying exercises&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Go for the green: one cup of kale contains more calcium than any dairy product&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Avoid stimulants: coffee and alcohol consumption which can leach healthy bones&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Increase your intake of Vitamin D&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Check your hormone levels and balance them with bio-identical pellet therapy&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;Numerous studies suggest the effectiveness of bio-identical hormone pellet therapy in preventing bone loss and deterioration. A 1992 report* in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; shows significant improvement in the bone mineral density of patients administered subcutaneous testosterone and estradiol pellets. Testosterone augments bone density, strength and ability to repair itself.According to a new report from the International Osteoporosis Foundation,* women arent the only ones who need to bone up on calcium. The foundation cites osteoporosis as the cause for broken bones in one out of every five men over 50 who are twice as likely as women to die from these fractures. It also finds that osteoporosis causes 27 percent more men to suffer a bone fracture than develop prostate cancer.Make no bones about it bio-identical hormone pellets offer a safe, natural approach that help prevent osteoporosis. Unlike other pellet therapies, SottoPelles web-based BioCalc system provides patients with a precise dose of the highest quality bio-identical hormone pellets designed to meet their individual needs.

"content": "Everywhere you look, men are sporting beards. Its colder outside, but what is the sudden interest in facial hair? Beards are back, and just in time for No-Shave November. Nobody likes going to the doctor and men are notorious for neglecting their health, especially when terms like prostrate exam are mentioned in hushed whispers. As October ends and the national attention to breast cancer awareness month subsides, its time to bring attention to men too.The concept is built around an initiative that partners with the American Cancer Society to grow awareness for cancer patients who lose hair by asking others to let it grow wild and free. The goals are awareness and the hope that the money saved by growing it out will be donated to cancer prevention.

"content": "People are getting ready to cook, spend time with lived ones and shop sales. It sounds like a recipe for gratitude or disaster.The holiday is a time that makes people very stressed. Some of the biggest causes of holiday stress are noted in a Consumer Reports Survey:&amp;quot;The holidays are supposed to be a time of comfort and joy, but 90% of Americans report stressing over at least one aspect of the merry season. &amp;quot;For all the chatter about nostalgia, family fun, and gift giving this time of year, many people dont like too much of a good thing,&amp;quot; said Tod Marks, senior editor at Consumer Reports.Here are the top 11 things that Americans dread about Christmas, according to a survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center:68%: Crowds and long lines37%: Gaining weight37%: Getting into debt28%: Gift shopping25%: Traveling24%: Seeing certain relatives23%: Seasonal music19%: Disappointing gifts16%: Having to attend holiday parties or events15%: Having to be nice12%: Holiday tipping &amp;quot;So how do we minimize our stress and actually enjoy the holiday season more?Take a breath and relax. If crowds and lines are an issue, then try shopping online. Also, factor in your time, effort, and stress before deciding if that holiday sale really is a great bargain? If you have to shop, try avoiding peak times of shopping. Shop with someone to offset the stress.Enjoy holiday food, but moderation in all things matter. If you know your going to be eating a lot or unhealthy things, try exercising more to offset the holiday barrage of calories.Many people feel an overwhelming pressure to buy gifts they cannot afford. Instead of using charge cards, use your debit cards to control spending cash on hand. Gifts are thoughtful gestures, if you have that family member who puts no thought into gift giving, lower your expectations on what you will get and focus on giving from the heart.During the holiday season, most of us are our own worst enemy. We dont take care of ourselves. Its hard not to be stressed if your eating poorly, not sleeping well, and dealing with the craziness that comes with the holiday season.&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/animated-turkey-with-football.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;Get lots of sleep, sunlight, and try to find humor in unpleasant situations.Plan for the worst and hope for the best. Holiday stress management can often seem like an exercise in survival skills.WebMD also provides these tips to reduce stress during the holidays:1. Put Stress in its Place: Its Not About the HolidaysPeople who get stressed out easily are most likely to feel intense stress during the holidays. Its really all about you, and not about the holidays. But theres good news. You can learn to put stress in its place, and take the pressure off throughout the year.&amp;quot;Stress and distress are often related to worrying about the future or fretting about the past,&amp;quot; says David Levingston, LMFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Brattleboro, Vt. To find peace and joy in any season, he advises focusing on the present moment.2. Create the Holiday You Want&amp;quot;When the holidays come around, there may be pressures pulling you in all directions off your center,&amp;quot; Levingston says. He suggests you make clear decisions about how you want to spend your time and resources. Do it early, before the decorations go up around town. Consider what is most important to you. What memories will you look back on when the season winds down?3. Have Compassion for Yourself and OthersEven if you shop less and focus on family time, stressed-out friends, in-laws, and co-workers may still come calling. How can you be a good friend and keep your calm?Try not to take things personally. Levingston says thats one of the most important skills you can learn to reduce stress. During the holidays in particular, he says, most people are trying to get their needs met. Maybe its their need for love or simply for validation. &amp;quot;Even if someone is being a jerk or insensitive, it is their way of trying to get their needs met,&amp;quot; Levingston says.So try not to think about how people &amp;quot;should be.&amp;quot; Accept them as they are, and release the tension from your body. &amp;quot;I think when we can see where people are coming from, there can be less frustration and more compassion,&amp;quot; Levingston says.SottoPelle wishes you a happy, healthy, and stress free Thansgiving!Sources:&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.prevention.com\/mind-body\/emotional-health\/solutions-holiday-stress&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.prevention.com\/mind-body\/emotional-health\/solutions-holiday-stress&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/parenting\/family-health-12\/reduce-holiday-stress?page=3&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/parenting\/family-health-12\/reduce-holiday-stress?page=3&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;"

The councils exercise converter shows that it would take 15 hours of skiing to burn off those calories that are the equivalent of seven Big Macs!Finding the balance between holiday merrymaking and healthy eating is challenging for most people at this time of year. Slipping in a few good habits in between those yummy egg-nogs will help you avoid any major holiday weight gain without feeling totally deprived.One study in the journal &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; shows that 45 minutes of early morning exercise helps reduce food cravings and keeps your metabolism fired up all day.Obesity experts also claim that starving yourself all day before the holiday bash wont reduce the calories.

It increases energy, strength, flexibility, agility and balance, while improving mental and cognitive functioning.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Recent Studies&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;While yoga has been around for thousands of years, recent studies from Harvard, the University of California and the University of Maryland have measured the physiological changes of yoga and meditation through neuro-imaging and genomics technology.There is a true biological effect, says John Weber Denninger, M.D.,PH.D., Director of Research at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of Harvard Medical Schools teaching hospitals. The kinds of things that happen when you meditate do have effects throughout the body, not just in the brain.University of California at Los Angeles and Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn found that 12 minutes of daily yoga meditation for eight weeks increased telomerase activity, an anti-aging enzyme, by 43 percent, suggesting an improvement in stress-induced aging.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Benefits - Hormones, Memory &amp;amp;amp; Aging&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;There are thousands of yoga poses or postures, also known as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;asanas&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;. Each one has a multitude of benefits. Aside from building strength and flexibility, different poses can also improve the functioning of the endocrine system, which helps the body adapt to hormonal fluctuations, minimize oxidative stress that reduces skins elasticity as we age, boost immunity levels, endorphins and blood circulation that can improve mental and cognitive performance.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Getting Started:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ujjayi (Oceans Breath)&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Linking breath with mediation and movement is key. The Ujjayi breathing technique invigorates the body while calming the mind. It helps concentration, holding yoga postures and moving from one pose to another.&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Eyes can be open or closed&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Place the tongue to the roof of your mouth&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Through your nose, take a long, smooth inhale&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Through your nose, take an equally long, smooth exhale&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Repeat&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Try These 2 Poses&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Shavasana (Corpse Pose)&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;The restorative pose of shavasana or savasana is ideal for relaxation and mediation.It can be done lying down on your back or stomach, with or without a pillow, arms relaxed and legs stretched out or bent with feet together.

"content": "The old song says &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;you better not cry, you better not shout&amp;quot;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; but, the holiday season can make the best of us want to scream. Dont worry youre not alone, and to unite all those feeling that extra pressure during the holiday season, Humbug Day is here for you!Scream, Shout, and Vent - let go of all that seasonal stress, at least for today. As in the words of our favorite Frozen Princess:&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Let it go, let it goCant hold it back anymoreLet it go, let it goTurn away and slam the doorI dont care what theyre going to sayLet the storm rage onThe cold never bothered me anyway&amp;lt;\/p&amp;gt;The holiday season is not always as fun as it should be (especially now that you wont be able to stop humming that Frozen song). It can be a very isolating time for many people, especially when people lose sight of what really matters in search of that perfect gift for Aunt Sue. Remember that shopping does not bring us the meaning of life, nor does one present make or break a day.National Humbug Day provides an outlet for venting your frustrations with the element of humor to allow a much needed &amp;quot;blow off some steam&amp;quot; before the festive season hits us all like an avalanche. It is no coincidence that the Grinch is green is it? Is he green from all the holiday cake or Christmas carols? Is it the jealousy of not having what he thinks others have? The moral of a Christmas Carol and Scrooge was that of self-redemption, so redeem yourself by letting out your stress and allow yourself to enjoy what has probably been there all along.Any ground rules for Bah Humbug Day? Take a break from the holiday madness and become a Scrooge for one day. Think of yourself and take a much needed mental vacation day. Vent and shout &amp;quot;Bah Humbug: a few times today - but try not to exceed a dozen as then you may just be annoying the other Grinches.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Here are some ways to celebrate and bring out the Humbug hiding within:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Avoid ALL and ANY Christmas music. If a holiday song comes on the radio, scream &amp;quot;bah humbug&amp;quot; and turn to another station quickly.&amp;quot; If youre in the mall or in a department store, wear ear muffs (preferable green furry ones). When your bestie turns on her Michael Bubl Christmas CD, roll your eyes, and leave the room in disgust.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Quote Grinch or Scrooge the entire day.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some sample quotes to mutter:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bah, Humbug Try it with an English Accent - it will get attention to your venting.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;quot;I want to wail in self-pity, and stare into the abyss&amp;quot;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;quot;hate, hate, hate, double hate....loathe entirely&amp;quot;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;If you still are not feeling the Bah Humbug then immediately:&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lock the door&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Cuddle up on the couch,&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Grab big tub of ice cream by yourself&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas.&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Bah Humbug to All !!!&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;"

(Which seems to happen earlier each year or is this just my imagination?) And with the advent of menopause - well, lets just say that I dont handle the stress nearly as well as before the Big M.A few years ago, I began to wonder why I get myself all worked up and frantic carrying out the mandatory rituals every November-December. Its not always easy to score a live tree here on my rural island, so I often opt out of the pine needle, broken ornaments (cause by cattus domesticus who cant stop playing with the shiny things), sugary dough all over the kitchen, unwritten Christmas card mess.And it is...heavenly.This year, Ive been way more gentle with myself. Thanksgiving was glorious at our neighbors house - potlucked of course. The day was lazy and filled with gratitude for us.We had a second Thanksgivingat home, just so we could have leftovers for sandwiches. No one was invited save us, so it didnt matter when the turkey got done or how many side dishes or if we even had dessert.Wow, two holiday feasts already and no stress so far. Im thinking that I may be on to something. Because the rituals have been cominapart at the seams, in the very best possible way, it was with absolute serenity that we cruised downtown to see the Christmas parade of lights and hang out with the entire islands population to celebrate, Hawaiian style.I am having a tree trimming party. Which involves putting miniature ornaments on a Lilliputian fake tree (about 4 inches tall). Yes, I mean inches, not feet. I can hold it in the palm of my hand.Of course, there will be eggnog and wine. We can sing Christmas carols. (Or not, maybe itd better to listen to Willie K. or Na Leo Pilimehana sing.)

"content": "While women are well aware of the fact that they will someday enter into menopause, many men are unaware of the term andropause. This term refers to a time when their reproductive hormones drop tremendously. It usually occurs between the ages 40 and 60 and is commonly listed under a variety of medical terms.When female menopause occurs, the ovaries cease to function or only intermittently. This means that ovulation and menstruation both end and that the female will eventually begin losing estrogen and testosterone hormones as well. She will be unable to have children at the completion of menopause.When a man enters andropause, he will begin to see either a gradual or significant drop in his testosterone levels. However, while a woman will no longer be able to have children, this is untrue for a man after andropause. His sperm production will continue and he will be able to father children well into his golden years.Menopause is a natural reaction to a womans body aging. However, there are some variables that can cause early onset in life. For example, women who excessively drink alcohol, have certain hormonal deficiencies, are obese or have a poor diet are all at risk from menopause occurring sooner rather than later. For women who have their ovaries or uterus removed, this will also speed up the process of menopause as well.One of the most common similarities that men and women will experience between menopause and andropause is that they are quickly returned to how they were before they entered into puberty. The symptoms that they experience through this process are often similar as well.Some of the most common symptoms that have been reported with both men and women are moodiness, depression, brain fog, hot flashes, night sweats, hair loss, low sex drive, weight gain, vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men, among many other complaints. Both men and women experience a sense of lack of sexuality and ultimately loss of control of their own bodies.Mid-life crisis as well as other noted psychological and emotional variations will also be noticed among both sexes as well. Just as in puberty when your hormones were on a rollercoaster, you may feel like you have returned to that crazy ride during menopause and andropause.Both medical phases of life have certain treatments that are available, effective, and that are medically recognized to improve quality of life. One of the most common treatment paths for both conditions is bio identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT). For both men and women this method will help to bring the hormone levels back to the proper levels. Managing the source of the problem delivers great relief in experienced symptons.It is important that a patient is carefully monitored by a doctor while they are undergoing BHRT treatment. The doctor should be experienced, trained, and empathize with what the patient is going through. Make sure your doctor is not just treating symptons, but the hormonal imbalance that both sexes have in middle age. Educate yourself, men and women can learn a lot if they research the different things that can be expected when experiencing these conditions. If you opt for BHRT make sure you receive quality care and pellets from a verified SottoPelle physician. Not all BHRT pellet treatment is created equally. But, when it comes to aging both men and women have equal issues and can be improved with the appropriate treatment and healthy lifestyle.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;"

"content": "The world is all about the selfie. As a culture we are consumed with body image, how we look to other people. Our cell phones now have cameras that have selfie mode to help us take pictures of ourselves easier. Then we can edit those images on our phones with beauty settings. The selfie is now transformed into something far different than ourselves. This obsession with how we look does not end with the awkward teenage years, it is following us until our middle age and beyond.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Is this a new occurrence? What is body mage? How is it defined? What happens to our body image as we reach middle age?&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/blog.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; No Expiration Date on BeautyBody image obsession is not a new thing. Over the centuries, women would corset themselves in search of the perfect hourglass figure. Ironically, this practice has recently seen a sudden resurgence in popularity. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What is old becomes new again&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;. Rubenesque figures were very much in fashion for a time as a sign of affluence, but we saw this trend quickly dissipate in the 1960s with models like twiggy. Weight should not be determined by what is in style but what is healthiest for the person.There has been a louder voice for acceptance for those who do not meet the weight standard we see on TV, magazines, social media, and basically everywhere. Many people live with the ingrained feeling that their own bodies are their enemy. Betraying them at every meal.One young writer discusses how her self image is determined by external influences:&amp;quot;The irony of body image is not based on how other people really see you, but only how you see yourself. It is not just a visual thing, but your sense and control your body as you move. How you feel in your body, not just about your body.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;If youd asked me when I was a little girl what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would have told you &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;thin.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; I lived and breathed the dreams of slenderness.The distance between my actual self and the self I wanted to be was massive, an impassable chasm that only seemed to grow with each skipped meal and each hour spent waiting for that special day the day I wouldnt be &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;me&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; anymore.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Because I was a girl, self-hatred was part of my cultural inheritance.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;If a person has a weak body image, then middle age will only overwhelm them. The changes in our body as men and women age are often traumatic to many individuals. Sudden weight gain, loss of hair, or growing too much hair, and the roller coaster of hormones can cause body image perceptions to falter further. Even with the most confident of people, body image takes a hard blow during middle age.If you are a person who is very body centric, then middle age will be a harder time to handle.Women who are more concerned with their physical appearance tend to have more negative attitudes about menopause, according to a new study published in the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Journal of Health Psychology&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;. To reach that conclusion, researchers surveyed 270 middle-aged women on topics like body image and perspective on menopause, and also engaged in more in-depth interviews with a handful of study participants. Unfortunately, the team also found, women with poor attitudes about menopause might be more likely to suffer from mental and physical health problems during their menopausal years.Why the link? Because our appearance (not to mention our sex drive and mood) tends to change during menopause. So women whove become used to being noticed, and have enjoyed the attention this bringslink menopause with aging and come to resent this phase and feel badly about it, says the studys lead author, Helena Rubinstein, PhD, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of Cambridge.What can you do to change your body image? The first thing to know, is that changing your body image does not mean changing your body. It is a lot like an opinion. You have to educate, research, and develop it to reach a balanced and objective one.Everyone wants to look like the ideal, but as the video below shows, those ideals are often not even real. The best way to improve your body image at ANY age is to start with health and happiness. Some suggestions from WebMD for improving our body image seem pretty easy and are mostly common sense, but it works:Start on the inside. For instance, can you stop saying you &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; certain parts of your body and start appreciating what your body does for you every day, from your lungs breathing, your heart beating, your brain guiding you through the days challenges, and your hands making a meal or holding someone elses hand?Being active, eating healthy food, and getting plenty of rest will also help.Eating healthy can promote healthy skin and hair along with strong bones. Exercise has been shown to boost self-esteem, self-image, and energy. Getting enough rest is key to stress management. All of these can make you feel good about your body.&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Most of all, learn to love yourself and you will quickly see yourself as others have all along!&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sources:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; http:\/\/www.nationaleatingdisorders.org\/what-body-image&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; http:\/\/everydayfeminism.com\/2013\/05\/lose-hate-not-weight\/&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; http:\/\/www.prevention.com\/mind-body\/emotional-health\/menopause-body-image-advice&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/beauty\/style\/love_your_body_inside_and_out&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;"

"content": "Its almost game day, you have spent the whole season watching and cheering your favorite team. A season filled with Sundays of chips, dips, and drinks. Super Bowl often means a day most people will overdo the snacks and alcohol. How do you have a fun tailgate or watch party, and be healthy? Be proactive, before heading out make your game plan. Before the pre-game festivities begin, WebMD offers these tips: &amp;quot;eat a light snack before you go so that you wont get tipsy with the first drink; it should also help reduce the temptation to dive into the food. Choose drinks that are relatively simple, such as coffee, tea, juice, wine, wine spritzers, light beer, or drinks mixed with low-calorie mixers. Sweet or creamy drinks add lots of extra fat and calories. Rum and diet cola or vodka and soda with a twist are good lower-calorie drink options. &amp;quot;(1) When it comes to Super Bowl even the CDC has advice. People tend to overdo it, so they advise to avoid: binge drinking, drinks with unknown alcohol content, or mixing alcohol with energy drinks. Take steps to make sure you and other guests avoid driving under the influence of alcohol. Plan ahead. Always designate a non drinking driver before any party or celebration begins. Dont drink and drive or let others drink and drive. Be a helpful host by reminding your guests to designate a sober driver and offer alcohol-free beverages.&amp;quot; (2) Remember to drink water and keep hydrated. Super Bowl is usual mid flu season, so getting worn down by over doing it can make you more susceptible to getting sick. Public places, flu season, dehydration, or junk foods are all a recipe for a bad hangover or feeling badly Monday morning after the game. If you are tailgating or outside, dress warmly and comfortable. This years Super Bowl is in Arizona, so the weather at the game should be comfortable for those fortunate enough to attend. All these tips are common sense, but many get caught up in the fan fun and forget to plan ahead for these scenarios. Be safe and plan for a fun game day.

As with anything else, some of its the old nature versus nurture scenario. Bad habits that you have nurtured through the years (poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, excessive alcohol, and other known risks) can take their toll. Some families have a history or are at a heightened risk of cardiac problems. Menopause itself does not cause cardiovascular disease.Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist and an American Heart Association volunteer restates.Menopause isnt a disease. Its a natural phase of a womans life cycle, Dr. Goldberg said. Its important for women, as they approach menopause, to really take stock of their health.Per the American Heart Association about 35,000 under the age of 50 will have a heart attack each year. Heart disease is the leading killer of women. It is suggested that there is a connection between the estrogen and the decline during menopause and the health of the heart and blood flow.

"content": "Have you ever been sitting at a dinner or with a group of friends and all of sudden the topic of conversation takes an uncomfortable turn? The topic is menopause and everyone starts cracking those hot flash or moody jokes, as if those feelings and experiences are funny. No one wants to be the butt of a joke. Making light of phases of life can help us get through the difficult aspects of those situations. But, when the joking is happening between couples, it can be devastating for the woman going through menopause. At a recent dinner, the jokes started and I said I went through that and it was horrible. It amazed me to see the conversation dynamically change and women started to ask questions about what to expect or relate their own experiences. It was interesting to note, the almost deafening silence of the men in the room. As if the women, had entered a space that was off limits to them.Men need to listen, acknowledge and respond to these conversations. If they dont know what to say then just to say I am not sure what to say, but I am here to listen. During menopause, women are just looking for support and reassurance that their changing bodies are not changing the way people feel about them.A woman rarely wants to hear her husband or family poke fun of her challenges with menopause. It is important for loved ones to support and acknowledge the many feelings and physical changes that are happening in a positive and encouraging manner. When menopause happens it impacts not only the woman but the entire family. Mom may be forgetful or short tempered. She may suddenly show a need for positive reinforcement for her self-esteem and body image. Ironically, many men are simultaneously experiencing a midlife crisis (which can be triggered by hormonal imbalance like andropause), which then just lends to more conflict between the couple. Suddenly, the man and the woman are changing and its important to remain consistent, faithful, and kind to each other during this time. This is not the time to say, Oh, mom is going through her changes, she is being nutty. Poking fun at the sudden weight gain and suggesting she lay off the cookies is not what she wants to hear during this time.A Womans Day article notesan increase in divorces after fifty-five due:&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;They enter their golden years and their husband walks out the door, often for a younger woman. Thats whats happening to an increasing number of women in their fifties and sixties these days. While divorce among younger people seems to be leveling off, theres a worrisome rise in marriage breakups among the over-fifty-five crowdup 22 percent in the last decade and expected to .&amp;lt;\/blockquote&amp;gt;Married life is challenging enough with bills, kids, and family. Add midlife bodily changes to the mix and couples are often pitted or bullying each other. Often men will isolate themselves as they are just not sure what to do or say in the midst of their wives rollercoaster or hormones. In most cases, this exactly the opposite of what women want from their husbands. The important thing to remember when going through this time is youre not alone. If you feel bullied by the jokes made or by the lack of understanding as others try to navigate the great unknown of menopause speak up. You might be surprised by the reaction when you do.&amp;amp;nbsp; http:\/\/www.familylife.com\/articles\/topics\/marriage\/staying-married\/husbands\/what-wives-wish-their-husbands-knew-about-menopause#.VL1Lo3snJx0&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;"

Pearson MD, FACS&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;EXCEED Hormone Specialists, 7512 Second Street, Germantown, Tenn. 38138 http:\/\/exceedhs.com\/Whats the secret to a healthy marriage or partnership? Sex isnt everything, but intimacy and romance are an important part of any intimate relationship. Studies suggest that good sex is also good for your health since elevated endorphin and oxytocin levels lower stress, elevate mood, and prompt more cuddling with your spouse or partner.Amidst all the valentine cards and heart-shaped chocolate boxes this month, the fact remains that many couples are unhappy with their sex lives. According to the American Medical Association, 43 percent of women and 31 percent of men in the U.S. admit they have a sexual problem. But most are too embarrassed to do anything about it except reach for the Viagra.While there are various physical, emotional and lifestyle issues that can lead to sexual dysfunction, research shows that hormonal imbalances are often a primary factor.Have you noticed? The symptoms of hormone deficiency that affect relationships are the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;same &amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;in both men and women. These often include:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;fatigue,&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;low energy&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;low libido&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;poor sexual functioning&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;loss of motivation&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;mood swings&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;What is happening to each of the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;individuals &amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;is also happening to the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;couple&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt; and amazingly they never see it. Each thinks the other has the problem!As specialists in hormone deficiency and sexual dysfunction, we initially noted this pattern in couples referred by marital, family therapy and sexual counselors. We also discovered that treating these patients and their hormone issues together as a couple is much more effective and can offer some them some hope and positive results.Testosterone is the key hormone for libido in both sexes and also generates a connection or bonding emotion between two partners. However, Low T levels have many men turning to potentially harmful forms of synthetic testosterone. Pills, patches, injections, gels and creams in generic doses can lead to hormone surges and other side effects.Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) pellets offer a safer, natural treatment option with precisely individualized dosing for both men and women to help restore hormones back to their proper levels.Doing BHRT together as a couple is a powerful way to help put the vitality back in your relationship. Co-treatment leads to improved compliance, earlier and better results and mutual satisfaction. With individual patients, we inquire very early about a significant other and their hormone symptoms. If possible, we then approach each individuals therapy in the context of the couples relationship.Why does this approach work? First, most couples are nearly the same age. Two-thirds of all married or cohabiting couples are within 2.5 years of each others age.Consequently, each half of the couple moves into hormonal difficulties at the same time.Women in the pre- and postmenopausal years from 40 to 60 are generally living with men of a similar age. In these men, testosterone levels are dropping and 50 percent have erectile dysfunction. Together they experience decreased hormones, loss of libido, sexual problems, moodiness and strained relationships.Second, relationships play a key role in overall health. Research shows that happy couples have a lower risk of heart disease. BHRT demonstrates benefit on heart and bone health, weight control, brain function and metabolism. Imagine the BHRT potential being magnified by the strength of the relationship!Finally, seeing ones partner make the change from poor health to optimal health, or simply associating with a healthy partner, is very powerful motivation and reinforcement. The British demonstrated this effect recently in a study of 3,700 couples attempting weight control, exercise or smoking cessation. Individuals were three times more likely to succeed if the partner joined in the challenge.The message: Fitness, vitality and BHRT all rub off on your partner.Its never too late to save your marriage or relationship! So this Valentines Day, dont turn to Viagra to spice up your sex life. Consider the natural option that BHRT offers you and your significant other for enhancing your health and revitalizing your romance so you can enjoy growing old together!&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;About Dr. Pearson and Dr. Chauhan:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?p=6764&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/doctors\/richard-pearson-md-facs\/&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;\/?p=6762&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http:\/\/www.sottopelletherapy.com\/doctors\/heather-pearson-chauhan-md-facog\/&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;"

"content": "&amp;lt;h2 class=&amp;quot;post-header&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Guest Post : &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;In this LifeLock UnLocked post, our friendsat the Identity Theft Resource Center outline the risks of medical identity theft.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/h2&amp;gt;A lot of people make New Years resolutions to make healthier choices in the coming year. For some, that resolution also translates into making appointments for much-needed health and dental screenings, vowing to follow up on previous diagnoses, and keeping a watch on medical conditions.But while youre taking better care of your body, this is also a good time to make a resolution to take better care of your medical identity. What is a medical identity? Well, for starters, it was the leading form of data breach in 2014, largely due to the reporting laws in place that require practitioners to report leaks of patient information. Your medical identity, just like your personal identity or your financial identity, is the information that a thief can use to his own benefit while harming your ability to receive care.Medical identity theft occurs when your personally identifiable information is used by someone else for health care, health coverage, disability benefits, and more. The end result can range from mild annoyance to a life threatening conflict of care, and can also have criminal consequences for the victim if its not resolved.In August 2014, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-birmingham-26519216&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;a woman used a stolen identity&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt; to give birth at a UK hospital because her three other children had already been removed from her care. Fearing that the new baby would also be taken, she used a stolen identity (of another pregnant woman) to give birth and leave the hospital with her baby. When the victim of the identity theft went to a routine appointment with her doctor, she was informed she had already given birth, jeopardizing her ability to receive prenatal and labor-delivery care.Medical identity theft can also have disastrous effects that can actually be life threatening. Imagine going to the emergency room and being given medication that youre allergic to because someone else has received care in your name and listed no known allergies. Even worse, you arrive at the hospital only to have the doctor look in your chart and see that you come in quite frequently for narcotic pain relievers, or youve previously been diagnosed with a complex physical or mental illness that interferes with your care. All because someone else is playing games with your identity and your health.Remember that medical data breaches often occur within the practitioners or hospital office in whats known as an internal data breach; an employee with access to your information can use it or sell it for someone else to use. Thats why its important to make a healthcare coverage screening part of your health maintenance. Those statements from your insurance company that arrive after a doctors visit? Dont just discard them, and not just because you need to shred them first. Read them very carefully and make sure you received the care that the statement claims you were given. But you dont have to wait for documentation to arrive, you can also check with your health coverage provider and ask for a routine look at your recent activity. If you receive any suspicious billing paperwork, follow up on it immediately in order to determine if someone is using your medical identity.&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This LifeLock UnLocked post is courtesy of the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http:\/\/www.idtheftcenter.org\/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Identity Theft Resource Center&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;\/em&amp;gt;"

"content": "BHRT or Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy helps restore hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone to their required levels. The hormones are taken from plant sources to produce molecules which are identical to the hormones our body naturally makes. BHRT is a safe and a reliable method and patients who undergo the treatment have reported feeling younger, more energetic and having decreased symptoms of menopause and andropause (male menopause) symptoms. The therapy is customized to an individuals requirements and is highly effective in both men and women. There are many benefits of BHRT which include:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Improved immune system&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Increased sex drive&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Balanced weight&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Improved skin condition&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Lower depression&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A new study also suggests that it helps in Parkinson disease and traumatic brain injury&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Parkinsons disease and BHRT:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Parkinsons disease (PD) causes the failure and death of critical nerve cells in the brain that are called neurons. PD usually strikes the neurons in the brain area called the substantia nigra that produces dopamine. Dopamine is responsible for communicating with the part of the brain that controls movement and coordination in a human body. As PD advances, dopamine production decreases which leaves a person unable to control his movements like a normal human being. This also inhibits his ability to exercise or maintain his fitness.However, with BHRT, PD patients have reported improvement in the following areas:&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reduced progression of PD symptoms&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reduced need for medicines&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An improvement in fitness&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;An improvement in coordination&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Better mobility&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Reduction in tremors&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;\/ul&amp;gt;These improvements are possible with BHRT as BHRT is able to increase the production of dopamine and decrease inflammation in the female brain and testosterone in the main brain. BHRT keeps hormones in balance and revives quality of life of PD patients. Balance of hormones means a steady flow of hormones in the blood stream that helps keep PD negative symptoms in check.Also, BHRT is customized as per the needs of the individual patient. This customization to the precise needs of the patients body is the key to the success of pellet therapy. SottoPelles patent pending dosing method BioCalc allows for the treating physician to dose the pellet therapy to exactly what that patients body requires to regain balance.&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Traumatic brain injury and BHRT:&amp;lt;\/strong&amp;gt;Research suggests that traumatic brain injury affects around 1.7 million Americans per year and it can cause cognitive, emotional as well as physical deficits. Most therapies do not provide significant improvements or recovery and the chronic symptoms continue to be a part of life of the patients forever. It has been found that brain trauma causes deficiencies in some types of hormones. When this deficiency in hormones is restored, a significant improvement is seen in patients that suffer from traumatic brain injury.BHRT are plant-based hormones that match the exact molecular structure, as well as functionality of the human hormones. Hence, BHRT bind and communicate properly to the human body receptors and hence, extend vital support to organs, tissues and cells in the human body. If prescribed properly, BHRT can benefit traumatic brain injury as well as menopause, weight gain, and even osteoporosis. Again, BHRT are customized personally and have virtually no side effects. Exact dosage needs of a patient are uncovered by a series of blood tests.BHRT needs to be researched upon even more to aid people in their illnesses and improved further to provide an even better outcome for patients suffering from PD, traumatic brain injury, etc.&amp;amp;nbsp;If you need more information about this topic or SottoPelle Therapy, please contact us today!!&amp;amp;nbsp;"

"content": "This has been one of the worst winters experienced around the country. Everyone is feeling the chill including the normally warmer Snow Bird states. We know that extreme cold can impact the elderly and children, but how does it impact those in middle age or going through Menopause?&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Menopause&amp;lt;\/h2&amp;gt;Everyone has heard about Hot Flashes during Menopause, but many women experience Cold Flashes. This A cold flash, often called the chills, is a sudden feeling of intense cold, usually accompanied with shivering. The difference between cold and shivering as a reaction to weather as opposed to a medical condition is the unexpected situation in which it happens. The brain monitors and regulates the bodys temperature, according to the University of Illinois Medical Center, and when something throws it off balance, such as menopause, chemicals will travel through the bloodstream, causing the brain to raise the normal temperature set point. This causes you to feel cold and shiver to help your bodys temperature rise to meet the new set point. Due to estrogen levels decreasing, hormonal and biochemical imbalances occur, according to the 34 Menopause Symptoms website. The falling estrogen levels are thought to be the cause of both hot and cold flashes. The hypothalamus, the area of the brain responsible for body temperature regulation, becomes overactive. This causes the hypothalamus to release chemicals that cause blood vessels in the skin to expand in order for heat to be emitted. The end result is a cold flash.During Perimenopause many women will experience cold intolerance. Often patients will complain that their hands, nose, and feet are very cold. Cold extremities can be caused by hormonal imbalance and will result in heightened discomfort during periods of extremely cold weather.It is important to avoid potential triggers of cold flashes by drinking warm drinks, take hot baths, wear sweaters or just try to maintain an even temperature in your residence. Keeping feet and hands warm can often help warm the rest of the body. Have warm slippers available that you can easily slip into and out of as your body temperature fluctuates. If the episodes become too disruptive, please contact your physician or our team for assistance on managing these symptoms.&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Exercise&amp;lt;\/h2&amp;gt;During cold weather it is often hard to exercise due to lack of motivation or environment. It is important to exercise and keep in shape. The cold weather will inhibit anyones desire to leave the warmth of their heated home or even get out from under the covers to hit the gym. Proper diet and exercise are critical for staying healthy at any age especially during cold weather. People tend to get ill more often during cold periods of time due to many factors. Lack of exercise, inhalation of cold air versus warm air, and poor diet (aka Comfort Food), are some of the reasons why many get sicker during the colder months.&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Diet&amp;lt;\/h2&amp;gt;Some great suggestions from EveryDayHealth.com for winter super-foods for menopause are:&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Legumes&amp;lt;\/h3&amp;gt;Some of the more bothersome symptoms associated with menopause result from a state of estrogen deficiency, says Erica Matluck, ND, a naturopath at One Medical Group in San Francisco.A diet rich in phytoestrogens can help with this, and soybeans, chickpeas, and lentils are some of the most potent sources. Legumes are also rich in folic acid, magnesium, potassium, B vitamins, and fiber, and are 20 to 25 percent protein, making them a true superfood. Matluck recommends including phytoestrogens in every meal.&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Flaxseed&amp;lt;\/h3&amp;gt;Flaxseeds high concentration of essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) can relieve inflammation, fluid retention, depression, and irritability, says Karyn Duggan, a certified nutrition consultant at One Medical Group.This little super-food with a nutty flavor is also a rich source of plant lignans. Those can modulate the metabolism and use of estrogen, and are therefore helpful for minimizing menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, sweating, and vaginal dryness, she says. Flaxseed can be purchased ground or whole and added to dishes like oatmeal and smoothies.&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Green Leafy Vegetables&amp;lt;\/h3&amp;gt;Fill your plate with cruciferous vegetables like kale, collards, or other leafy greens. These greens are good sources of calcium and magnesium, both of which are beneficial for bone health, says Denise Londergan, RD, LD, an integrative dietitian\/nutritionist at Ohio State Universitys Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.Magnesium-rich foods can also help with migraines, depression, and anxiety, reports the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health.&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Cold-Water Fish&amp;lt;\/h3&amp;gt;Fish that thrive in cold waters salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring, for instance are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which help relieve hot flashes and symptoms of depression in women over 40, according to a study published in the journal Menopause in 2011. Omega-3s also help protect against heart disease, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute an increasing concern for women as they reach menopause. Federal dietary guidelines for Americans recommend incorporating a serving of fish into meals at least two times each week.These are just a few suggestion, there are others listed on this site and others.
